<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>I am glad to take this opportunity to acknowledge
the use I have made of a manuscript written by
Mrs. Charlotte Wilson, Hon. Secretary of the
Fabian Women’s Group. The manuscript was
founded on a lecture, entitled “The Economic
Disintegration of the Family,” delivered by Mrs.
Wilson to the Fabian Society in June, 1909.
Not only ideas contained in the lecture, but also
some of the wording of the manuscript, have been
used in the last two chapters.</p>

<p>I wish also to thank Dr. Ethel Bentham for
the invaluable professional service rendered by
her during the five years of the investigation.</p>

<h1>ROUND ABOUT
A POUND A WEEK</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DISTRICT</span></h2>

<p>Take a tram from Victoria to Vauxhall Station.
Get out under the railway arch which faces
Vauxhall Bridge, and there you will find Kennington
Lane. The railway arch roofs in a din
which reduces the roar of trains continually
passing overhead to a vibrating, muffled rumble.
From either end of the arch comes a close procession
of trams, motor-buses, brewers’ drays,
coal-lorries, carts filled with unspeakable material
for glue factory and tannery, motor-cars, coster-barrows,
and people. It is a stopping-place
for tramcars and motor-buses; therefore little
knots of agitated persons continually collect on
both pathways, and dive between the vehicles
and descending passengers in order to board the
particular bus or tram they desire. At rhythmic
intervals all traffic through the arch is suspended
to allow a flood of trams, buses, drays, and vans,
to surge and rattle and bang across the opening
of the archway which faces the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>At the opposite end there is no cross-current.
The trams slide away to the right towards the
Oval. In front is Kennington Lane, and to the
left, at right angles, a narrow street connects with
Vauxhall Walk, leading farther on into Lambeth
Walk, both locally better known as The Walk.
Such is the western gateway to the district
stretching north to Lambeth Road, south to
Lansdowne Road, and east to Walworth Road,
where live the people whose lives form the subject
of this book.</p>

<p>They are not the poorest people of the district.
Far from it! They are, putting aside the tradesmen
whose shops line the big thoroughfares such
as Kennington Road or Kennington Park Road,
some of the more enviable and settled inhabitants
of this part of the world. The poorest people—the
river-side casual, the workhouse in-and-out,
the bar-room loafer—are anxiously ignored by
these respectable persons whose work is permanent,
as permanency goes in Lambeth, and
whose wages range from 18s. to 30s. a week.</p>

<p>They generally are somebody’s labourer, mate,
or handyman. Painters’ labourers, plumbers’
labourers, builders’ handymen, dustmen’s mates,
printers’ labourers, potters’ labourers, trouncers
for carmen, are common amongst them. Or they
may be fish-fryers, tailors’ pressers, feather-cleaners’
assistants, railway-carriage washers,
employees of dust contractors, carmen for
Borough Council contractors, or packers of various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
descriptions. They are respectable men in full
work, at a more or less top wage, young, with
families still increasing, and they will be lucky if
they are never worse off than they now are.
Their wives are quiet, decent, “keep themselves-to-themselves”
kind of women, and the children
are the most punctual and regular scholars, the
most clean-headed children of the poorer schools
in Kennington and Lambeth.</p>

<p>The streets they live in are monotonously and
drearily decent, lying back from the main arteries,
and with little traffic other than a stray barrel-organ,
a coal-lorry selling by the hundredweight
sack, or a taxi-cab going to or from its driver’s
dinner at home. At certain hours in the day—before
morning school, at midday, and after four
o’clock—these narrow streets become full of
screaming, running, shouting children. Early in
the morning men come from every door and pass
out of sight. At different times during the evening
the same men straggle home again. At all
other hours the street is quiet and desperately dull.
Less ultra-respectable neighbourhoods may have
a certain picturesqueness, or give a sense of community
of interest or of careless comradeship,
with their untidy women chatting in the doorways
and their unoccupied men lounging at the street
corners; but in these superior streets a kind of
dull aloofness seems to be the order of the day.</p>

<p>The inhabitants keep themselves to themselves,
and watch the doings of the other people from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
behind window curtains, knowing perfectly that
every incoming and outgoing of their own is also
jealously recorded by critical eyes up and down
the street. A sympathetic stranger walking the
length of one of these thoroughfares feels the
atmosphere of criticism. The rent-collector, the
insurance agent, the coalman, may pass the time
of day with worn women in the doorways, but a
friendly smile from the stranger receives no
response. A weekly caller becomes the abashed
object of intense interest on the part of everybody
in the street, from the curious glances of the greengrocer’s
lady at the corner to the appraising stare
of the fat little baker who always manages to be
on his doorstep across the road. And everywhere
along the street is the visitor conscious of eyes
which disappear from behind veiled windows.
This consciousness accentuates the dispiriting
outlook.</p>

<p>The houses are outwardly decent—two stories
of grimy brick. The roadway is narrow, but on
the whole well kept, and on the pavement outside
many doors there is to be noticed, in a greater or
less condition of freshness, a semicircle of hearthstone,
which has for its radius the length of the
housewife’s arm as she kneels on the step. In
some streets little paved alley-ways lead behind
the front row of houses, and twist and turn among
still smaller dwellings at the back—dwellings
where the front door leads downwards into a
room instead of upwards into a passage. Districts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of this kind cover dreary acres—the same
little two-story house, with or without an inconceivably
drearier basement, with the same
kind of baker’s shop at the corner faced by the
same kind of greengrocer’s shop opposite. The
ugly, constantly-recurring school buildings are a
relief to the spirit oppressed by the awful
monotony.</p>

<p>The people who live in these places are not
really more like one another than the people who
live in Belgrave Square or South Kensington.
But there is no mixture of rich and poor, no
startling contrast, no crossing-sweeper and no
super-taxpayer, and the first impression is that of
uniformity. As a matter of fact, the characteristics
of Mrs. Smith of Kennington and the characteristics
of Mrs. Brown who lives next door are
more easily to be differentiated by a stranger in
the street than are the characteristics of Mrs.
Smythe of Bayswater from those of Mrs. Browne
who occupies the house next to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Brown, though they may
never be seen by the passer-by, are able to imprint
their personality on the street because their ways
are open, and meant to be open, to all whom it may
concern. Mrs. Smith likes red ochre at her door,
in spite of the children’s boots messing it all over
the floor. Moreover, she likes to cover the big
flagstone in front of the door, and two lesser
stones, one on each side; she makes the edges
coincide with the cracks, and produces a two-winged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
effect of deep importance. It is likely
that Mrs. Smith’s mother lived in a village where
not to do your doorstep thus was a social sin,
where perhaps there was but one flagstone, and
Mrs. Smith in her childhood was accustomed to
square edges.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown “can’t abide that nasty stuff,”
and uses good hearthstone, as her mother taught
her to do. Mrs. Brown prefers also the semi-circular
sweep of the arm which secures the
rounded edge and curved effect which satisfy her
sense of propriety and usualness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith has a geranium in a pot in her front
window, and the lace curtains which shield her
privacy behind it are starched and blued according
to some severe precedent ignored by the other
ladies of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown goes in for a scheme of window
decoration which shows the dirt less. She has
a row of red and yellow cocoa tins to make a
bright effect.</p>

<p>The merest outsider calling for the first time on
Mrs. Smith knows her beforehand for the decent,
cleanly soul she is, and only wonders whether the
struggle of life has worn her temper to fiddle-strings
or whether some optimistic strain in her
nature still allows her to hope on. The same
outsider looking at Mrs. Brown’s front door and
window would realize her to be one who puts a
good face on things, and, if it happened to be the
right time of a day which was not washing-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
probably would expect, after the proper ceremonial
had been gone through, to be asked in to
sit behind the cocoa tins.</p>

<p>Who could tell anything half so interesting
from the front doors of Mrs. Smythe and Mrs.
Browne of Bayswater? Who could tell, on
meeting each of these ladies face to face, more
than her official age and the probable state of her
husband’s purse?</p>

<p>The children of the street are equally different
from one another both in character and appearance,
and are often startlingly good-looking.
They have shrill voices, clumsy clothes, the look
of being small for their age, and they are liable
to be comfortably dirty, but there the characteristics
they have in common cease. They may be
wonderfully fair, with delicate skins and pale
hair; they may have red hair, with snub-nosed,
freckled faces; or they may be dark and intense,
with long, thick eyelashes and slender, lithe
bodies. Some are apathetic, some are restless.
They are often intelligent; but while some are
able to bring their intelligence to bear on their
daily life, others seem quite unable to do so. They
are abnormally noisy. Had they been well
housed, well fed, well clothed, and well tended,
from birth, what kind of raw material would
they have shown themselves to be?</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PEOPLE</span></h2>

<p>It was this question which started an investigation
which has been carried on for four years by
a committee of the Fabian Women’s Group. A
sum of money was placed at the disposal of this
committee in order to enable them to study the
effect on mother and child of sufficient nourishment
before and after birth. Access was obtained
to the list of out-patients of a well-known lying
in hospital; names and addresses of expectant
mothers were taken from the list, and a couple
of visitors were instructed to undertake the
weekly task of seeing each woman in her own
home, supplying the nourishment, and noting
the effects. From as long as three months before
birth, if possible, till the child was a year old, the
visits were to continue. The committee decided
that the wives of men receiving over 26s. a week
were likely to have already sufficient nourishment,
while the wives of men out of work or receiving
less than 18s. a week were likely to be living
in a state of such misery that the temptation to
let the rest of the family share in the mother’s
and baby’s nourishment would be too great.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
They therefore only dealt with cases where the
wages ranged between 18s. and 26s. a week.
After two years’ experience they raised the higher
limit to 30s.</p>

<p>For the convenience of visiting it was necessary
to select an area. The district described in the
previous chapter was chosen because it is within
reach of the weighing centre, where each infant
could be brought once a fortnight to see the doctor
and have its weight recorded. A member of the
committee who is a doctor interviewed each
woman before the visits began, in order to ascertain
if her health and her family history were
such that a normal baby might be expected. It
was at first proposed to rule out disease, but
pulmonary and respiratory disease were found to
be so common that to rule them out would be
to refuse about half the cases. It was therefore
decided to regard such a condition of health as
normal, and to refuse only such cases of active
or malignant disease in the parents as might, in
the doctor’s opinion, completely wreck the child’s
chance of a healthy life.</p>

<p>Drink, on the other hand, the committee had
expected to find a normal condition, and had
proposed the acceptance of moderate drinking.
Experience, however, went to prove that married
men in full work who keep their job on such a
wage do not and cannot drink. The 1s. 6d. or 2s.
which they keep for themselves has to pay for
their own clothes, perhaps fares to and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
work, smoking and drinking. It does not allow
much margin for drunkenness. A man whose
wife declared him to be “spiteful” on Saturday
nights was certainly the worse for drink on
Saturday nights; but never once during sixteen
months of weekly visiting did he omit to bring
his wife her full allowance. He had kept his job
for many years, and the explanation is that he
was given tips at the theatre for which he worked.
The tips he, not unnaturally, considered to be
peculiarly his own.</p>

<p>One other man, who could make fair wages
when in work, turned out thoroughly unsatisfactory.
He was not a drunkard, but he would
have been if he could have afforded it. Otherwise
the record is fairly clear. Men who earned
overtime money or who received tips might
spend some of it on beer, but the regular wage
was too close a fit to allow of much indulgence.
Many of the men were teetotallers, and some did
not even smoke.</p>

<p>It was found to be necessary, in order to secure
the success of the investigation, to inaugurate a
system of accurate accounts. In no case were
these accounts already in being, and it was therefore
the task of the visitors to teach each woman
in turn to keep a record of her expenditure for
the week. As the greater part of this volume
is to do with these weekly budgets, this is a good
opportunity to explain why they are credible
evidence of real conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>A working man’s wife in receipt of a regular
allowance divides it as follows: Rent; burial
insurance; coal and light; cleaning materials;
clothing; food. A short experience in helping
her to sort her items on paper shows the investigator
how to prove their accuracy. Rent is easy.
There is always the rent-book if the family deals
direct with the landlord; and if the rooms are
sublet from the real tenant, the woman who
sublets them is only too anxious to explain either
that rent is owing or that it is paid regularly, and
how much a week it is. Burial insurance is easy.
The insurance-book tells the whole story. With
regard to such items as coal, gas, soap, and food,
experience enables an intelligent investigator to
compare accounts of women who do not know of
one another’s existence in such a manner as to
know, almost before the woman has spoken, what
she is likely to be spending. If a woman says that
she is buying 1 cwt. of coal a week in the winter,
and paying 1s. 6d. for it, dozens of other accounts
of which she knows nothing corroborate her. If
she says she is burning 1¾ cwt. in the winter, and
spending 2s. 7½d., the price is known to be correct;
it only remains to question the quantity. In
one case the reason is that the rooms are basement
rooms, very damp and very dark. In another
there are eight children, with a very large copper
fire to be kept going on washing-days. In a
third no gas is laid on, and all the cooking has to
be done by the stove. All these conditions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
there to be seen. With regard to food the same
test applies. Is the budget peculiar, or does it
bear out thirty others, allowing, of course, for
difference in size of family and in size of income?
If it is peculiar, why? The explanation is
generally simple and obvious. In cases where
there is no explanation—of which there have
been two only—the family is not visited any
further. As a matter of fact, the budgets have
borne out each other in the most striking manner.
There seems to be so little choice in the manner
of keeping a family on 20s. a week.</p>

<p>The women were with one consent appalled at
the idea of keeping accounts. Not that they did
not “know it in their heads,” as they anxiously
explained; but the clumsy writing and the difficult
spelling, and the huge figures which refused to
keep within any appointed bounds, and wandered
at will about the page, thoroughly daunted
them.</p>

<p>Eight women were found who could neither
read nor write. They said that it was not thought
of much consequence when they were girls; but
they evidently found it extremely humiliating
now, from the difficulty with which the acknowledgment
of their disability was pumped out of
them. Of these eight, three had husbands who
undertook the task for them. The men’s handwriting
was excellent, the figures and spelling clear
and correct, but at first details were lamentably
absent. “Groceries,” even “sundries,” were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
common entries, and, as the scribe was always
away at work, the visitor was left to the mercy
of bursts of memory on the part of the mother,
whose anxious efforts to please at any cost might
land everybody concerned in further difficulties.
The only method in such cases was to make her
sit down and shut her eyes, pretend the visitor
was her “young man” (generic term for husband),
and think it out all over again. Pencil in
hand, the eager listener caught and made accounts
out of such recollections as these: “’E give me
twenty-two bob a Satterday. After I put Ernie
ter bed I went shoppin’ in the Walk.” Long
pause. “I know I got ’arf a shoulder er mutton at
1s. 9d., an’ 3 pounds er pertaters, and they was 1½d.,
an’ a cabbage w’ich ’e said was as fresh as a daisy,
but it turned out to be all fainty like w’en I come
to cook it.” When the record is taken down in
proper form, it is compared with the masculine
accounts. If the two agree, jubilation; if not,
why not? And we begin all over again. After
a few weeks of such experiences the husband
always reformed.</p>

<p>Other illiterate women employed an eldest
child of perhaps ten or eleven years of age. In
these cases a certain kind of painstaking accuracy
could be relied upon, but, far from resorting to
masculine short-cuts, these little secretaries
usually went to the other extreme, and gave way
to a prolix style, founded, doubtless, on the
maternal manner of recollecting. One account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
kept in large copybook hand by Emma, aged
eleven, began as follows: “Mr G’s wages was
19 bob out of that e took thruppons for es diner
witch is not mutch e bein sutch a arty man.
The rent was six and Mrs G payed fower an six
because Bobby’s boots was off is feet and his
knew ones was one an six witch makes six and
that leaves 12 an 9 and out of that,” etc. It
took four pages of painstaking manuscript in a
school exercise-book to complete one week. This
serial story had to be reduced, though with regret,
to the limits of ordinary accounts.</p>

<p>Other young scribes had special tricks, such as
turning their fractions upside down or running
two or more words into one. “Leggerbeef” and
“dryaddick” recurred week after week in one
book, and “lberpeces” in another. The first
two only had to be pronounced to solve their
own riddle, but the third had to be worried
through recollection after recollection till it
turned out to mean “1 lb. of pieces,” or 1 lb. of
scraps of meat.</p>

<p>The women who kept their accounts for themselves
were found to be better arithmeticians than
they were writers. Their addition had a disconcerting
way of being correct, even when the
visitor seemed to get a different total. But, then,
the spelling was sometimes beyond the sharpened
wits of the most experienced Fabian women to
comprehend. Great care had to be taken not to
hurt their feelings as they sat anxiously watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the visitor wrestling with the ungainly collection
of words and figures. “Coull” did not mean
coal, which appeared as “coles” quite clearly
lower down. It was Lambeth for cow-heel.
“Earrins too d” meant “herrings, 2d.”
“Sewuitt” is simple, more so than “suit,” a
common form of “suet”; but “wudanole” and
“curince” gave some trouble. They stood for
“wood and oil” and “currants.” Seeing the
visitor hesitate over the item “yearn 1d.,” the
offended mother wrote next week “yearn is for
mending sokes.”</p>

<p>Some of the women—in fact, the majority—wrote
a good hand and spelled fairly well. Those
who had before marriage been in work where
anything of the kind was expected of them—such
as that of a tea-shop waitress or of a superior
domestic servant—quickly turned into interested
and competent accountants. But the older
women, and those who had had no reason to use a
pencil after leaving school, had completely lost
the power of connecting knowledge which might
be in their minds with marks made by their hand
on a piece of paper. These women were curiously
efficient in a kind of mental arithmetic, though
utterly at sea directly pencil touched paper.
On the whole, accounts came into being sooner
than at first sight seemed possible.</p>

<p>The women were suspicious and reserved.
They were all legally married women, because
the hospital from whose lists their names had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
taken dealt only with married women. They conquered
their reserve in most cases, but not in all.
Some were grateful; some were critical. At the
beginning of each case the woman seemed to steel
herself to sit patiently and bear it while the
expected questions or teaching of something
should follow. She generally appeared to be
conscious that the strange lady would probably
like to sit in a draught, and, if complimented on
her knowledge of the value of fresh air and open
windows, she might repeat in a weary manner
commonplaces on the subject which had obviously
been picked up from nurse, doctor, or
sanitary inspector.</p>

<p>They spoke well of their husbands when they
spoke of them at all, but it is the children chiefly
who fill their lives. The woman who said, “My
young man’s that good ter me I feel as if somethink
nice ’ad ’appened every time ’e comes in,” was
obviously speaking the simple truth, and she was
more articulate than most of the others, whose
“’E’s all right” might mean as much. Another
woman introduced the subject as follows: “’E’s
a good ’usbin. ’E ain’t never kep’ back me
twenty-three bob, but ’e’s that spiteful Satterday
nights I ’as ter keep the children from ’im.”
“And what do <em>you</em> do?” asked the interested
visitor. “Oh, me? That’s all right. I’m
cookin’ ’is supper,” she explained, as though to a
child.</p>

<p>On the whole they seemed to expect judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to be passed on the absent man according to the
amount he allowed them. Many were the
anxious explanations when the sum was less than
20s.—that it was “all ’e got,” or that “’e only
keeps one and six, an’ ’e buys ’is cloes ’isself, an’
’e’s teetotler an’ don’t ’ardly smoke at all.” The
idea among them, roughly speaking, seemed to
be that if he allowed less than 20s. explanations
were required; if 20s., nothing need be said
beyond “It ain’t much, but you can’t grumble.”
If over 20s., it was rather splendid, and deserved
a word of notice about once in six weeks, when it
would be good manners for the visitor to say,
“I see Mr. A. never fails to bring you your twenty-two,”
and Mrs. A. would probably answer, “’E’s
all right,” but would look gratified.</p>

<p>The homes are kept in widely different states
of order, as is to be expected. There is the
rigidly clean and tidy, the fairly clean and tidy,
the moderately clean but very untidy. The difference
depends on many factors: the number
of children, the amount of money to spend,
the number of rooms, the personality of the
husband and the personality of the wife. Six
or eight children give a great deal of work, and
leave very little time in which to do it. In a
family of that number there is nearly certain,
besides the baby, to be an ex-baby, and even
perhaps an ex-ex-baby, all at home to be looked
after all day long and to create fresh disorder
every minute. The amount of money to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
affects cleanliness very closely. It decides the
number of rooms; it decides the amount of soap
and of other cleaning materials and utensils;
and it probably decides the question of water
laid on or water to be carried up from the backyard,
and, when used, down again. A family of
four children in one room is a problem. Two
may be at school part of the day, but two will
be at home all the time, and there will be no
moment when the mother can put them to sleep
in another room and get rid of them while she
washes and cleans. Her chance of peace or method
is small with the always recurring work of the
dinner to cook and the utensils to wash, with the
children ever present in the same room.</p>

<p>But the personality of the parents is, of course,
the chief cause of order or disorder. A man who
loves order has a great influence for order, and a
man who likes to go to bed in his boots and spit
on the floor has an almost overwhelming influence
in the other direction. He may be an equally
good fellow in all other respects, but his wife, if
she has a tidy nature, may quarrel bitterly with
him; whereas if she is more easy-going she may
remain his good friend, through not feeling constant
irritation and insult because of his ways.
It is a fact that a woman the law of whose being
is cleanliness and order at all costs may, to a
slovenly man, make a most tiresome wife. Her
little home may be shining and spotless—as far
as anything can be shining and spotless in Lambeth—at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the cost of all her vitality and all her
temper. She herself may, as a result of her
desperate battle with dirt and discouragement,
be a scold and an unreasonable being. She cannot
be got away from in two rooms where a light and
fire can only be afforded in one, and she may be
the greatest trial in an always difficult life. In
such homes as £1 a week can buy in London, the
women who do not insist upon doing the impossible,
and fretting themselves and everybody else
because it is impossible, often arrive at better
results—with regard at least to the human beings
about them—than the women who put furniture
first and the peace of the family second. And
this even if the rooms in their charge do look as
though their dark places would not bear inspection.
The mother who is not disturbed by a
little mud on the floor has vitality left to deal
with more important matters.</p>

<p>To manage a husband and six children in three
rooms on round about £1 a week needs, first
and foremost, wisdom and loving-kindness, and
after that as much cleanliness and order as can
be squeezed in. The case where the man loves
order and the woman is careless may also be
prolific of strained relations between the parents.
But a steady woman who is not as tidy as her
husband might wish has many ways of producing
a semblance of order which makes for peace while
he is there, and the friction is less likely to be
intense. Of course, if both parents are orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
by nature all is well. The home will be clean,
and the children will be brought up in tidy ways,
much to their advantage. But if there are to be
constant and bitter recriminations over the state
of the house, better, for the man’s sake, the
children’s sake, and the woman’s sake, a dingy
room where peace and quiet are than a spotless
abode where no love is.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">HOUSING</span></h2>

<p>How does a working man’s wife bring up a family
on 20s. a week? Assuming that there are four
children, and that it costs 4s. a week to feed a
child, there would be but 4s. left on which to
feed both parents, and nothing at all for coal,
gas, clothes, insurance, soap, or rent. Four
shillings is the amount allowed the foster-mother
for food in the case of a child boarded out by
some Boards of Guardians; therefore it would seem
to be a justifiable figure to reckon upon. But for
a woman with 20s. a week to spend it is evidently
ridiculously high. If the calculation were to be
made upon half this sum, would it be possible?
The food for the children in that case would
amount to 8s. To allow the same amount to
each parent as to each child would not be an
extravagance, and we should on that basis arrive
at the sum of 12s. a week for the food of six
people. That would leave 8s. for all other
expenses. But rent alone may come to 6s. or
7s., and how could the woman on 20s. a week
manage with 1s., or perhaps 2s., for coal, gas,
insurance, clothes, cleaning materials, and thrift?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual answer to a question of this kind is
that the poor are very extravagant. It is no answer.
It does not fit the question. But what matter if
only it saves people from thinking? Another
answer sometimes given is that everything in
districts where people are poor is cheaper, because
the people are poor, than it would be in districts
where people are rich. Now, is that so? If it
were, it might in some degree help to solve the
problem.</p>

<p>To take the item of rent:—a single room in
Lambeth, 15 feet by 12 feet, upstairs, with two
windows—a good room—costs a poor man 4s.
a week. A house containing eighteen rooms in
South Kensington, for rent, rates, and taxes, may
cost a rich man £250 a year. If the rich man
were to pay 4s. a week for every 20 square
yards of his floor space, he would pay, not £250
a year, but £285. If he were to pay 4s. a week
for the same amount of cubic space for which the
Lambeth man is paying his 4s., he would pay,
not £250 a year, but £500. Added to which he
gets an elaborate system of water laid on (hot
and cold), baths, waste pipes and sinks from top
to bottom of the house. He also gets an amount
of coal-cellarage which enables him to buy his
coal cheap, and he gets good air and light and
space round his house, so that he can keep his
doctor’s bills down. He certainly has a better
bargain for his £250 a year than the poor man
has for his 4s. a week. Therefore it is not true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to say that a family can be brought up on 20s.
a week in Lambeth because a poor man can make
a better bargain over his rent than can a rich
man. As a matter of fact, we see that he actually
pays more per cubic foot of space than the rich
man does.</p>

<p>A comparison might be made in something like
the following way:</p>

<table summary="Comparison of the proportion of their income paid in rent by men with different earnings" class="comparison">
  <tr>
    <td class="col1">A middle-class well-to-do man with income of £2,000</td>
    <td>might pay in rent, rates, and taxes, £250—</td>
    <td>a proportion of his income which is equal to <em>one-eighth</em>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="col1">A middle-class comfortable man, with income of £500</td>
    <td>might pay in rent, rates, and taxes, £85—</td>
    <td>a proportion of his income which is equal to about <em>one-sixth</em>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="col1">A poor man with 24s. a week, or £62 8s. a year,</td>
    <td>might pay in rent, rates, and taxes, 8s. a week, or £20 16s. a year—</td>
    <td>a proportion of his income which is equal to <em>one-third</em>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If the man with £2,000 a year paid one-third of
his income in rent, rates, and taxes, he would pay
£666 a year, while the man with £500 a year
would pay £166, and they would both be better
able to afford these sums than the poor man is
able to afford his £20 16s. Allowing that each of
them has a wife and four children to maintain,
there would at least be enough left in both families
to give sufficient nourishment to every member.
Fewer servants might be kept, there might be
less travelling, plainer clothes, and less saving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but enough to eat there would be. But the poor
man, having no expenditure other than food
which can be cut down, is obliged, in order to pay
one-third of his income in rent, to cut down
food.</p>

<p>The chief item in every poor budget is rent,
and on the whole and roughly speaking it is safe
to say that a family with three or more children
is likely to be spending between 7s. and 8s. a
week on rent alone. Why do they spend so much
when, as we see, it must mean cutting down such
a primary necessary as food?</p>

<p>To find the answer to this question, an analysis
was made of the conditions of thirty-one families
with three or more children who happened to
come within the scope of the investigation. The
analysis took the form of a comparison of the
death-rate in those families as related to the
number of children in each, the household allowance
of each, and the amount paid in rent by each.
Household allowance was chosen rather than
wage, as being necessarily in closer touch with
household expenditure than is the actual wage,
from which a varying amount of pocket-money
for the man is generally taken.</p>

<p>Amount paid in rent was chosen rather than
number of rooms, because low rent, though often
meaning fewer rooms, may quite as likely mean
basement rooms, or unusually small rooms, or
rooms in a very old cottage below the level of an
alley-way. One good upstairs room may cost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
much as a couple of dark and damp basement
rooms, and, though that one room may mean
horrible overcrowding for a family of five or
six persons, it may nevertheless be a wiser and
healthier home than the two-roomed basement,
where the overcrowding would nominally be less.
As a matter of fact, owing to insufficient beds and
bedding, the whole family would probably sleep
in one of the two basement rooms, and therefore
the air space at night would be no more adequate
than in one room upstairs, while bronchitis and
rheumatism would be added to the dangers of
overcrowding.</p>

<p>The percentages given in the little table on
p. 26 are calculated approximately to the nearest
whole number below.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, while the death-rate
increases from nothing in the case of families
with only three children to 40 per cent. and over
in the case of families with ten or eleven children,
the intermediate percentages do not follow in
numerical order. Families with five children
have a worse death-rate than families with six,
seven, or eight.</p>

<p>In the same way, if you compare death-rates
according to household allowances, the death-rate
of families with between 20s. and 22s. a
week is actually higher than that of families with
less than 20s.</p>

<p>When, however, the amount paid in rent is the
basis of the arrangement, the death-rate rises
from 12 per cent. to 40 per cent. as the rent
gets less.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to point out that the
death-rate is a rough-and-ready test, and not to
be considered as a close indication. If it were
practicable to use the general health of those
alive as well as the death-rate, it would be far
better. Also, of course, no one of the three
arrangements is independent of the other two.
Moreover, the numbers are few. The results of
the analysis, however, though proving nothing,
were considered interesting enough to encourage
the making of the same analysis of thirty-nine
cases of families with three or more children, taken
from the records of the weighing-room at Moffat’s
Institute (see p. 28). The two lists were kept
separate, as the cases at Moffat’s Institute had
been passed by no doctor, and hereditary disease
may be considered to be more rampant among
them. Added to this the wages are, on the whole,
lower than the wages of families within the limits
of the investigation.</p>

<p>It is curious that the death-rate in the second
table for families paying under 6s. rent is
much the same as it is in the first. The great
difference between the two tables lies in the far
larger death-rate in families paying over 6s.
rent shown in the second table, where disease
and insecurity and poverty were certainly greater
factors.</p>

<p>It is not pretended that the two tables do more
than indicate that decent housing has as much
influence on children’s health as, given a certain
minimum, the quality and quantity of their
food. That is to say, it is as important for a
young child to have light, air, warmth, and
freedom from damp, as it is for it to have sufficient
and proper food.</p>

<p>The kind of dwelling to be had for 7s. or 8s.
a week varies in several ways. If it be light, dry,
and free from bugs, if it be central in position,
and if it contain three rooms, it will be eagerly
sought for and hard to find. Such places exist
in some blocks of workmen’s dwellings, and
applications for them are waiting long before a
vacancy occurs, provided, of course, that they
are in a convenient district. There are even sets
of three very small rooms at a rental of 5s. 6d. in
one or two large buildings. These are few in
number, snapped up, and tend to go to the man
with not too large a family and in a recognised
and permanent position.</p>

<p>Perhaps the next best bargain after such rooms
in blocks of workmen’s dwellings is a portion of a
small house. These small houses are let at rents
varying from 10s. to 15s., according to size,
condition, and position. They are let to a tenant
who is responsible to the landlord for the whole
rent, and who sublets such rooms as she can do
without in order to get enough money for the
rent-collector. She is often a woman with five
or six children, who would not, on account of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
large family, be an acceptable subtenant. If
she is a good woman of business, it is sometimes
possible for her to let her rooms advantageously,
and stand in herself at a low rental—as rents go
in Lambeth. But there is always a serious risk
attached to the taking of a whole house—the risk
of not being able to sublet, or, if there are tenants,
of being unable to make them pay. Many a
woman who nominally stands at a rent of 6s. or
6s. 6d. for the rooms which she keeps for her own
use is actually paying 11s. to 15s. a week, or is
running into debt at the rate of 5s. to 10s. a
week because of default on the part of her lodgers.</p>

<p>The ordinary housing for 8s. a week consists
generally of three rooms out of a four-roomed
house where the responsible tenant pays 10s. or
11s. for the whole, and sublets one small room
for 2s. to 3s., or of three or four rooms out of a
five- or six-roomed house where the whole rent
might be 14s. or 15s., and a couple of rooms
may be sublet at 6s. or 7s. Some of the older
four-roomed houses are built on a terrible plan.
The passage from the front door runs along one
side of the house straight out at the back. Two
tiny rooms open off it, a front one and a back
one. Between these two rooms, at right angles
to the passage, ascends a steep flight of stairs.
Because of the narrowness of the house the stairs
have no landing at the top, but continue as stairs
until they meet the wall. Where the landing
should be, but is not, two doors leading into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
front bedroom and a back stand opposite one
another, and open directly on to the steps themselves.
Coming out of a bedroom with a child
in their arms, obscuring their own light from the
door behind them, many a man and woman in
Lambeth has trodden on the edge of a step and
fallen down the stairs to the ground below. There
is no hand-rail, nothing but the smooth wall on
each side.</p>

<p>Of the four little rooms contained in such a
house, perhaps not one will measure more than
12 feet the longer way, and there may be a copper
wedged into the tiny kitchen. A family of eight
persons using three rooms in a house of this kind
might let off the lower front room to an aunt or
a mother at a rent of 2s. 6d. a week, live in the
kitchen, and sleep in the two upstairs rooms.
The advantage of such a way of living is its
privacy. The single lodger, even if not a relative,
is less disturbing than would be another family
sharing another house. When the lodger is a
relative, a further advantage is that a child is
often taken into its grandmother’s or aunt’s room
at night, and the terrible overcrowding is relieved
just to that extent.</p>

<p>In some districts four rooms may be had for
8s. a week—on the further side of Kennington
Park, for instance. Here the plan of the house
is more modern. The stairs face the front door,
have a hand-rail and any light which the passage
affords. The front room may be 12 feet square,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and the kitchen, cut into by the stairs, 10 feet
square. There is a tiny scullery at the back,
which is of enormous value, as the 10 feet square
kitchen is the living-room of the family—sure to
be a fairly large one or it would not take four
rooms. Upstairs are three rooms. Two at the
back will be very small, and the front one,
extending the whole breadth of the house,
perhaps 15 feet by 12 feet. A family of ten
persons, now living in a house like this, lets off
one of the small back bedrooms at a rental of
2s., and occupies the four remaining rooms at a
cost of 8s. a week. The copper belongs to the
woman renting the house, who makes what
arrangements she pleases with her lodger in
regard to its use.</p>

<p>There are four-roomed cottages in Lambeth
where there is no passage at all. The front door
opens into the front room. The room behind
opens out of the front room. The stairs lead out
of the room behind, and twist up so as to serve
two communicating rooms above. Here the
upstairs tenants are forced to pass through
both the rooms of the lower tenants every time
they enter or leave the house. The inconvenience
and annoyance of this is intense. Both exasperated
families live on the edge of bitter feud.</p>

<p>There are two-roomed cottages reached by
alley-ways, where both tiny rooms are below the
level of the pathetic garden at the door. Here
one sanitary convenience serves for two cottages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Here the death-rate would be high, but not so
high as the death-rate in the dismal basements.</p>

<p>Where two families share a six-roomed house,
the landlady of the two probably chooses the
ground-floor, with command over the yard and
washing arrangements. The upstairs people contract
with her for the use of the copper and yard
on one day of the week. The downstairs woman
hates having the upstairs woman washing in her
scullery, and the upstairs woman hates washing
there. Differences which result in “not speaking”
often begin over the copper. Three rooms
upstairs and three rooms downstairs would be
the rule in such a house, the downstairs woman
being answerable to the landlord for 13s. a week,
and the upstairs woman paying her 6s. Each
woman scrubs the stairs in turn—another fruitful
source of difficulty. Some of these houses are
frankly arranged for two families, although the
landlord only recognises one tenant. In such
cases, though there is but one copper, there will
be a stove in an upstairs room. In some houses
the upstairs people have to manage with an open
grate and a hob, and nearly all of them have to
carry water upstairs and carry it down again
when dirty.</p>

<p>On the whole, the healthiest accommodation
is usually to be found in well-managed large
blocks of workmen’s dwellings. This may be as
dear as three rooms for 9s., or it may be as cheap
as three very small rooms for 5s. 6d. The great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
advantages are freedom from damp, freedom
from bugs, light and air on the upper floors,
water laid on, sometimes a yard where the
children can play, safe from the traffic of the
street. But there are disadvantages. The want
of privacy, which is very great in the cheaper
buildings, the tendency to take infection from
other families, the noise on the stairs, the inability
to keep a perambulator, are some of them. Then
there is no such thing as keeping the landlord
waiting. The rent must be paid or the tenant
must quit. The management of most buildings
exacts one or two weeks’ rent in advance in order
to be on the safe side. A tenant thus has one
week up her sleeve, as it were, but gets notice
directly she enters on that week. In some
buildings the other people, kindly souls, will lend
the rent to a steady family in misfortune. A
carter’s wife—one of the cases in the investigation—had
her rent paid for ten weeks, while her
husband was out of work and bringing in odd
sums far below his usual wage, by the kindness of
the neighbours, who saw her through. She was
in good buildings, paying a low rent, and as she
said, “If I’d a-got out of this I’d never a-got in
agen.” She paid off the money when her husband
was in work again at the rate of 3s. 6d.
a week.</p>

<p>The three-quarters of a small house or the half
of a larger house are likely to be less healthy
than “buildings,” because houses are less well-built,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
often damp, often infested with bugs which
defy the cleanest woman, have as a rule no water
above the ground-floor, and may have fearful
draughts and no proper fireplace. Their advantages
are the superior privacy and possibly
superior quiet, their accessibility from the street,
and, above all, the elasticity with regard to rent.
On the whole, the actual landlord is by no means
the monster he is popularly represented to be.
He will wait rather than change a good tenant.
He will make no fuss if the back rent is paid ever
so slowly. To many respectable folk, keeping
the home together on perhaps 22s. a week, this
is an inestimable boon. It is wonderful how,
among these steady people, rent is made a first
charge on income, though naturally, given enough
pressure, rent must wait while such income as
there is goes to buy food.</p>

<p>Rents of less than 6s. a week are generally
danger-signals, unless the amount is for a single
room. Two rooms for 5s. 6d. are likely to be
basement rooms or very small ground-floor rooms,
through one of which, perhaps, all the other
people in the house have to pass. One of two
such rooms visited for fifteen months measured
8 feet by 12 feet, had doors in three sides of it,
and was the only means of exit at the back of the
house.</p>

<p>Two sets of basement rooms at 5s. 6d. visited
during the investigation were extremely dark and
damp. In both cases the amount of coal burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
was unusually large, as was also the amount of gas.
One of these basements was reached by stairs
from within the house, the other from a deep area
without. The former was warmer, but more airless,
while the latter was impossible to warm in
any way. The airlessness of basement dwellings
is much enhanced by the police regulations, which
insist on shut windows at night on account of the
danger of burglary! Both the women in these
two homes were languid and pale, and suffered
from anæmia. The first had lost three children
out of seven; the second, one out of four.</p>

<p>Four and six paid for two rooms meant two
tiny rooms below the level of the alley-way outside—rooms
which measured each about 12 feet
square. A family of six persons lived in them.
Four children were living, and five had died.</p>

<p>The question of vermin is a very pressing one
in all the small houses. No woman, however clean,
can cope with it. Before their confinements some
women go to the trouble of having the room they
are to lie in fumigated. In spite of such precautions,
bugs have dropped on to the pillow of the
sick woman before the visitor’s eyes. One woman
complained that they dropped into her ears at
night. Another woman, when the visitor cheerily
alluded to the lovely weather, answered in a voice
of deepest gloom: “Lovely fer you, miss, but it
brings out the bugs somethink ’orrible.” The
mothers accept the pest as part of their dreadful
lives, but they do not grow reconciled to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Re-papering and fumigation are as far as any landlord
goes in dealing with the difficulty, and it
hardly needs saying that the effects of such treatment
are temporary only. On suggesting distemper
rather than a new paper in a stuffy little
room, the visitor was met with the instant protest:
“But it wouldn’t keep the bugs out a
minute.” It would seem as though the burning
down of such properties were the only cure.</p>

<p>The fault is not entirely that either of the sanitary
authorities or of the immediate landlords.
Nor is the blame to be given to the people living
in these houses. In spite of being absurdly
costly, they are too unhealthy for human habitation.
Sanitation has improved vastly in the last
dozen years, though there is still a great need for
more qualified, authoritative women sanitary inspectors.
But no inspection and no subsequent
tinkering can make a fundamentally unhealthy
house a proper home for young children. The
sanitary standard is still deplorably low. That
is simply because it has to be low if some of these
houses are to be considered habitable at all, and
if others are to be inhabited by two, and often by
three, families at the same time.</p>

<p>The landlords might use a different system
with advantage to the great majority of their
tenants. To insist on letting a whole house to
tenants who are invariably unable to afford the
rent of it is to contract out of half the landlord’s
risks, and to leave them on the shoulders of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
far less able to bear them. A woman who can
barely stagger under a rent of 6s., 7s., or 8s.,
may at any moment find herself confronted with
a rent of 10s. 6d. or 15s., because, in her desperate
desire to let at all, she is forced to accept an unsatisfactory
tenant. Turned into a landlord in
her own person, she is wonderfully long-suffering
and patient, but at the cost of the food of her
family. If ejectment has to be enforced, she, not
the real landlord, has to enforce it. She goes
through great stress rather than resort to it.
Houses intended for the use of more than one
family should, I consider, be definitely let off to
more than one family. Each tenant should deal
direct with the landlord.</p>

<p>The tenants might do more for themselves if
they understood and could use their rights—if
they expected to be more comfortable than they
are. They put up with broken and defective
grates which burn twice the coal for half the heat;
they accept plagues of rats or of vermin as acts
of God; they deplore a stopped-up drain without
making an effective complaint, because they are
afraid of being told to find new quarters if they
make too much fuss. If they could or would
take concerted action, they could right a great
many of the smaller grievances. But, when all
is said and done, these reforms could do very
little as long as most of the present buildings exist
at all, or as long as a family of eight persons can
only afford two, or at most three, small rooms to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
live in. The rent is too dear; the houses are too
old or too badly built, or both; the streets are
too narrow; the rooms are too small; and there
are far too many people to sleep in them.</p>

<p>The question is often asked why the people
live where they do. Why do they not live in a
district where rents are cheaper, and spend more
on tram fares? The reason is that these overburdened
women have no knowledge, no enterprise,
no time, and no cash, to enable them to
visit distant suburbs along the tram routes, even
if, in their opinion, the saving of money in rent
would be sufficient to pay the extra outlay on
tram fares. Moreover—strange as it may seem
to those whose bi-weekly visit to Lambeth is like
a bi-weekly plunge into Hades—the people to
whom Lambeth is home want to stay in Lambeth.
They do not expect to be any better off elsewhere,
and meantime they are in surroundings they
know, and among people who know and respect
them. Probably they have relatives near by who
would not see them come to grief without making
great efforts to help them. Should the man go
into hospital or into the workhouse infirmary,
extraordinary kindness to the wife and children
will be shown by the most stand-off neighbours,
in order to keep the little household together
until he is well again. A family who have lived
for years in one street are recognised up and
down the length of that street as people to
be helped in time of trouble. These respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
but very poor people live over a morass of such
intolerable poverty that they unite instinctively
to save those known to them from falling into it.
A family which moves two miles away is completely
lost to view. They never write, and there
is no time and no money for visiting. Neighbours
forget them. It was not mere personal liking
which united them; it was a kind of mutual respect
in the face of trouble. Even relatives cease
to be actively interested in their fate. A fish-fryer
lost his job in Lambeth owing to the business
being sold and the new owner bringing in his own
fryer. The man had been getting 26s. a week,
and owed nothing. His wife’s brothers and
parents, who lived near by, combined to feed
three of the four children; a certain amount of
coal was sent in; the rent was allowed to stand
over by a sympathetic landlady to whom the
woman had been kind in her confinement; and
at last, after nine weeks, the man got work at
Finsbury Park at 24s. a week. Nearly £3 was
owing in rent, but otherwise there was no debt.
The family stayed on in the same rooms, paying
3s. a week extra as back rent, and the man walked
daily from south of Kennington Park to Finsbury
Park and back. He started at five in the morning,
arrived at eight, and worked till noon, when
he had four hours off and a meal. He was allowed
to lie down and sleep till 4 p.m. Then he worked
again till 10 p.m., afterwards walking home, arriving
there at about one in the morning. A year of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
this life knocked him up, and he left his place at
Finsbury Park to find one in a fish-shop in Westminster
at a still slightly lower wage. The back
rent is long ago paid off, and the family, now with
five children, is still in the same rooms, though in
reduced circumstances. When questioned as to
why he had remained in Kennington instead of
moving after his work, the man pointed out that
the back rent would seem almost impossible to
pay off at a distance. Then there was no one
who knew them at Finsbury, where, should misfortune
overtake them again, instead of being
helped through a period of unemployment, they
would have nothing before them but the “house.”</p>

<p>It is obvious that, in London at any rate, the
wretched housing, which is at the same time more
than they can afford, has as bad an influence
on the health of the poor as any other of their
miserable conditions. If poverty did not mean
wretched housing, it would be shorn of half its
dangers. The London poor are driven to pay
one-third of their income for dark, damp rooms
which are too small and too few in houses which
are ill-built and overcrowded. And above the
overcrowding of the house and of the room comes
the overcrowding of the bed—equally the result
of poverty, and equally dangerous to health.
Even if the food which can be provided out of
22s. a week, after 7s. or 8s. has been taken for
rent, were of first-rate quality and sufficient in
quantity, the night spent in such beds in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
rooms in such houses would devitalise the children.
It would take away their appetites, and
render them more liable to any infection at home
or at school. Taken in conjunction with the
food they do get, it is no wonder that the health of
London school-children exercises the mind of the
medical officials of the London County Council.</p>

<span class="smaller">FURNITURE—SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION—EQUIPMENT
FOR COOKING AND BATHING</span></h2>

<p>It is difficult to say whether more furniture or
less furniture would be the better plan in a home
consisting of three rooms. Supposing the family
to consist of eight persons, most people would be
inclined to prescribe four beds. As a matter of
fact, there will probably be two. In a double bed
in one room will sleep father, mother, baby, and
ex-baby, while in another bed in another room
will sleep the four elder children. Sometimes
the lodger granny will take a child into her bed,
or the lodger uncle will take a boy into his; but
the four in a bed arrangement is common enough
to need attention. It must be remembered again
that these people are respectable, hard-working,
sober, and serious. They keep their jobs, and they
stay on in the same rooms. They are not slum
people. They pay their rent with wonderful
regularity, and are trusted by the landlord when
for any reason they are obliged to hold it back.
But, all the same, they have to sleep four in a bed,
and suffer the consequences. It is not an elastic
arrangement; in case of illness it goes on just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
same. When a child has a sore throat or a rash
it sleeps with the others as usual. By the time
a medical authority has pronounced the illness
to be diphtheria or scarlet fever, and the child is
taken away, perhaps another child is infected.
Measles and whooping-cough just go round the
bed as a matter of course. When a new baby is
born, the mother does not get her bed to herself.
There is nowhere for the others to go, so they
sleep in their accustomed places. This is not a
fact which obtrudes itself on the notice of a
visitor as a rule. She arrives to find the mother
and child alone in the bed, with the exception,
perhaps, of a two-year-old having its daily nap
at the foot. But in a case where there was but
one room, and where the man was a night-worker,
the visitor of the sick woman found him
asleep beside her. This discovery led to questions
being put to the other women, who explained
at once that of course their husbands and children
sleep with them at night. Where else is there
for the unfortunate people to sleep? Moreover,
the husband is probably needed to act as monthly
nurse at night for the first week. It is an arrangement
which does not allow of real rest for any of
them, but it has to be put up with.</p>

<p>The rooms are small, and herein lies the open-window
difficulty far more than in the ignorance
of the women. Poor people dread cold. Their
one idea in clothing their children is to keep them
warm. To this end they put on petticoat over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ragged petticoat till the children are fettered by
the number of garments. It is not the best
method, but it is the best method they know of.
The best, of course, would be so to feed the children
that their bodies would generate enough
heat to keep them warm from within without
unnecessary clothing. A second-best method
might be to clothe the badly-nourished bodies
warmly and lightly from without. The best they
can do is to load the children with any kind of
clothing they can procure, be it light and warm
or cold and heavy. The best is too expensive;
the second-best is too expensive; and so they
have recourse to the third. It is all they can do
with the means at their disposal. So with sleeping
and fresh air. The best arrangement is a
large room, a bed to oneself, plenty of bedclothes,
and an open window. The second-best is a small
room, a bed for every two persons, plenty of bedclothes,
and an open window. The only arrangement
actually possible is a tiny room, one bed for
four people, one blanket or two very thin ones,
with the bed close under the window. In wet
or very cold weather the four people in the
bed sleep with the window shut. What else
can they do? Here are some cases each visited
for over a year during the investigation:</p>

<p>1. Man, wife, and three children; one room,
12 feet by 10 feet; one bed, one banana-crate cot.
Man a night-worker. Wages varying from 16s.
to 20s. Bed, in which woman and two children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
slept all night, and man most of the day, with its
head half across the window; cot right under
the window.</p>

<p>2. Man, wife, and four children; one room,
12 feet by 14 feet; one bed, one cot, one banana-crate
cot. Wage from 19s. to 22s. The bed and
small cot stood alongside the window; the other
cot stood across it.</p>

<p>3. Man, wife, and six children; four rooms;
two beds, one sofa, one banana-crate cot. Wage
22s. One double bed for four people in very
small room, crossing the window; cot in corner by
bed. One single bed for two people (girls aged
thirteen and ten years) in smaller room, 8 feet by
10 feet, with head under the window. One sofa
for boy aged eleven years in front downstairs room,
where police will not allow window to be open at
night. The kitchen, which is at the back, has the
copper in it, and is too small for a bed, or even a
sofa to stand anywhere.</p>

<p>4. Man, wife, and five children; two rooms;
one bed, one sofa, one perambulator. Wage
22s. One bed for four persons across window in
tiny room; perambulator for baby by bed; one
sofa for two boys in kitchen, also tiny.</p>

<p>5. Man, wife, and four children; two basement
rooms; one bed, one baby’s cot, one sofa. One
bed for four, with baby’s cot by it, in one room;
sofa for child of nine in the other. In front room
the police will not allow the window open at night.</p>

<p>6. Man, wife, and five children; three small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
rooms upstairs; two beds, one cot; one double
bed for three persons, with head to window, cot
beside it, in one room; one wide single bed for
three persons across window in other room.</p>

<p>7. Man, wife, and five children; two rooms
upstairs; one wide single bed, one narrow single
bed, one cot. Wife sleeps with two children in
wide single bed, baby in cot by her side. Two
children under window in tiny back room in
narrow single bed. The man works at night, and
gets home about four in the morning. He sits up
on a chair till six o’clock, when his wife gets up
and makes up the children’s bed in the back room
for him.</p>

<p>There are plenty more of such cases. Those
above have been taken at random from an alphabetical
list. In one a woman and five children
sleep in one room, but, as it is large enough to
have two windows, they can keep one open, and
are better off than many parties of four in smaller
rooms, where the bed perforce comes under the
only window.</p>

<p>It may be noticed that in some of the cases
given, as in some which I have no space to give,
a third or fourth room, which is generally the
living-room, has no one sleeping in it at night.
The women, when asked why they do not relieve
the pressure in the family bedroom by putting a
child or two in the kitchen, explain that they have
no more beds and no more bedclothes. Each
fresh bed needs blankets and mattress. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
look round the tiny room, and ask, “Where’d I
put it if I ’ad it?” Besides, to put a couple of
children to bed in the one living-room makes it
both a bad bedroom and a bad sitting-room, even
if the initial difficulty of bed and bedding could
be overcome.</p>

<p>It will be noticed, too, that in the list given a
cot of some sort was always provided for the
little baby. Unfortunately, this is not a universal
rule. It appears here because the investigation
insisted on the new baby having a cot to itself.
Otherwise it would have taken its chance in the
family bed. In winter the mothers find it very
difficult to believe that a new-born baby can be
warm enough in a cot of its own. And when one
looks at the cotton cot blankets, about 30 inches
long, which are all their wildest dreams aspire to,
one understands their disbelief. The cost of a
cot at its cheapest runs as follows: Banana-crate
with sacking bottom, 1s.; bag filled with chaff
for mattress, 2d.; blankets, 1s. 6d. bought wholesale
and sold at cost price. This mounts up to
2s. 8d., and, for a woman who has to buy blankets
at an ordinary shop, a quality good enough for
the purpose would cost her more. She would have
to spend something like 3s. 6d. over the child’s
cot—a sum which is beyond the reach of most
women with a 20s. budget. As a rule it would
be safe to say that the new baby does take its
share of the risks of the family bed, legislation to
the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest of the furniture is both as insufficient
and crowded as is the sleeping accommodation.
There are not enough chairs, though too many
for the room. There is not enough table space,
though too much for the room. There is no
wardrobe accommodation other than the hook
behind the door, and possibly a chest of drawers,
which may partly act as a larder, and has in the
visitor’s experience been used as a place in which
to put a dead child.</p>

<p>To take an actual case of a one-room tenement.
There are four children, all living. The man is
a dusky, friendly soul who usually addresses an
elderly visitor as “mate.” On first making his
acquaintance, the visitor was so much struck by
the brilliance of his teeth shining from his grimy
face, that she ventured to express her admiration.
“Yes, mate, an’ I tell yer why: ’cause I cleans
’em,” he answered delightedly, and after a short
pause added, “once a week.” On one occasion
the visitor, noticing that a slight pressure was
needed on a certain part of the baby’s person,
looked for a penny in her purse, found none, but
was supplied by the interested father. The
penny was quickly stitched into a bandage, and
tied firmly over the required place. The next
week saw the family in dire need of a penny to
put in the gas-meter in order to save the dinner
from being uncooked. At the moment of crisis
a flash of genius inspired the father; the baby
was undressed, the penny disinterred, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
dinner saved. The visitor, arriving in the middle
of the scene, could but accept the position, sacrifice
a leaden weight which kept the tail of her
coat hanging as it should, and rebandage the baby.</p>

<p>The single room inhabited by this family is
large—15 feet by 13 feet—and has two windows.
Under the window facing the door is the large
bed, in which sleep mother, father, and two children.
A perambulator by the bedside accommodates
the baby, and in the further corner is a
small cot for the remaining child. The second
window can be, and is, left partly open at night.
At the foot of the bed which crosses the window
is a small square table. Three wooden chairs
and a chest of drawers complete the furniture,
with the exception of a treadle machine purchased
by the mother before her marriage on the
time-payment system. The small fireplace has
no oven, and open shelves go up each side of it.
There are two saucepans, both burnt. There is
no larder. On the floor lies a loose piece of
linoleum, and over the fireplace is an overmantel
with brackets and a cracked looking-glass. On
the brackets are shells and ornaments. Tiny
home-made window-boxes with plants in them
decorate each window. The whole aspect of the
room is cheerful. It is not stuffy, because the
second window really is always open. The overmantel
was saved for penny by penny before
marriage, and is much valued. It gives the room
an air, as its mistress proudly says.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Another family with eight children, all living,
rent four rooms—two downstairs and two up.
Downstairs is a sitting-room 10 feet by 12 feet.
In it are a sofa, a table, four chairs, and the perambulator.
A kitchen 10 feet by 10 feet contains
a tiny table and six chairs. The cupboard beside
the stove has mice in it. A gas-stove stands in
the washhouse beside the copper. By it there
is room for a cupboard for food, but it is a very
hot cupboard in the summer. One bedroom with
two windows, upstairs, has a large bed away from
the window, in which sleep mother and three
children. The baby sleeps in a cot beside the
bed, and in a small cot under one window sleeps
a fifth child. One chair and a table complete the
furniture. In another bedroom, 10 feet by 8 feet,
sleep two children in a single bed by night, and
the father, who is a night-worker, and any child
taking its morning rest, by day. The remaining
child sleeps on the sofa downstairs, where the
window has to be shut at night.</p>

<p>Another family with six children rent three
rooms. The kitchen has the copper in it, and
measures 12 feet by 10 feet. A table of 4 feet by
2 feet under the window, three chairs, a mantel-shelf,
and a cupboard high up on the wall, complete
the furniture. Food can be kept in a perforated
box next the dust-hole by the back door.
The room has a tiny recess under the stairs beside
the stove, where stands the perambulator in the
daytime, though it goes upstairs to form the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
baby’s bed at night. In one bedroom, 12 feet by
10 feet, is a big bed near the window, in which
sleep father, mother, and one child, with the
baby by the bedside. In another smaller room
sleep four children under the window, in one bed.
No other furniture.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in none of the bedrooms
are any washing arrangements. The daily ablutions,
as a rule, are confined to face and hands
when each person comes downstairs, with the
exception of the little baby, who generally has
some sort of wash over every day. Once a week,
however, most of the children get a bath. In the
family of eight children mentioned above, the
baby has a daily bath in the washing-up basin.
On Friday evenings two boys and a girl under
five years of age are bathed, all in the same water,
in a washing-tub before the kitchen fire. On
Saturday nights two boys under eleven bathe
in one water, which is then changed, and two
girls of nine and twelve take their turn, the
mother also washing their hair. The mother
manages to bathe herself once a fortnight in the
daytime when the five elder children are at school,
and the father goes to public baths when he can
find time and afford twopence.</p>

<p>A woman with six children under thirteen
gives them all a bath with two waters between
them on Saturday morning in the washing-tub.
She generally has a bath herself on Sunday
evening when her husband is out. All the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
has to be carried upstairs, heated in her kettle,
and carried down again when dirty. Her husband
bathes, when he can afford twopence, at the public
baths.</p>

<p>In another family, where there are four children
in one room and only a very small washtub, the
children get a bath on Saturday or Sunday. The
mother manages to get hers when the two elder
children are at school. The father, who can
never afford a twopenny bath, gets a “wash-down”
sometimes after the children have gone
to sleep at night. “A bath it ain’t, not fer grown-up
people,” explained his wife; “it’s just a bit at
a time like.” Some families use the copper when
it is built in the kitchen or in a well-built scullery.
But it is more trouble to empty, and often belongs
to the other people’s part of the house. All of
these bathing arrangements imply a great deal of
hard work for the mother of the family. Where
the rooms are upstairs and water is not laid on,
which is the case in a great many first-floor tenements,
the work is excessive.</p>

<p>The equipment for cooking is as unsatisfactory
as are the arrangements for sleeping or bathing.
One kettle, one frying-pan, and two saucepans,
both burnt, are often the complete outfit. The
woman with 22s. a week upon which to rear a
family may not be a professed cook and may not
understand food values—she would probably be
a still more discouraged woman than she is if she
were and if she did—but she knows the weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
points of her old saucepans, and the number of
pennies she can afford to spend on coal and gas,
and the amount of time she can allow herself in
which to do her cooking. She is forced to give
more weight to the consideration of possible time
and possible money than to the considerations of
excellence of cooking or extra food value. Also
she must cook for her husband food which he likes
rather than food which she may consider of
greater scientific value, which he may dislike.</p>

<p>The visitors in this investigation hoped to
carry with them a gospel of porridge to the hard-worked
mothers of families in Lambeth. The
women of Lambeth listened patiently, according
to their way, agreed to all that was said, and did
not begin to feed their families on porridge.
Being there to watch and note rather than to
teach and preach, the visitors waited to hear,
when and how they could, what the objection
was. It was not one reason, but many. Porridge
needs long cooking; if on the gas, that means
expense; if on an open fire, constant stirring and
watching just when the mother is most busy
getting the children up. Moreover, the fire is
often not lit before breakfast. It was pointed
out that porridge is a food which will keep when
made. It could be cooked when the children are
at school, and merely warmed up in the morning.
The women agreed again, but still no porridge.
It seemed, after further patient waiting on the
part of the visitors, that the husbands and children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
could not abide porridge—to use the expressive
language of the district, “they ’eaved at it.”</p>

<p>Why? Well cooked the day before, and eaten
with milk and sugar, all children liked porridge.
But the mothers held up their hands. Milk!
Who could give milk—or sugar either, for that
matter? Of course, if you could give them milk
and sugar, no wonder! They might eat it then,
even if it was a bit burnt. Porridge was an awful
thing to burn in old pots if you left it a minute;
and if you set the pot flat on its bottom instead
of holding it all to one side to keep the burnt place
away from the flame, it would “ketch” at once.
An’ then if you’d happened to cook fish or “stoo”
in the pot for dinner, there was a kind of taste
come out in the porridge. It was more than they
could bear to see children who was ’ungry, mind
you, pushin’ their food away or ’eavin’ at it. So
it usually ended in a slice of “bread and marge”
all round, and a drink of tea, which was the breakfast
they were accustomed to. One woman
wound up a long and patient explanation of why
she did not give her husband porridge with: “An’,
besides, my young man ’e say, Ef you gives me
that stinkin’ mess, I’ll throw it at yer.” Those
were the reasons. It is true that to make porridge
a good pot which is not burnt, and which
is not used for “fish or stoo,” is needed. It is
also true that to eat porridge with the best results
milk is needed. If neither of these necessaries
can be obtained, porridge is apt to be burnt or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
half cooked, and is in either case very unpalatable.
Children do not thrive on food they loathe,
and men who are starting for a hard day’s work
refuse even to consider the question. What is
the mother to do? Of course, she gives them
food they do like and can eat—bread and margarine
or bread and jam, with a drop of hot weak
tea. The women are very fond of Quaker oats
when they can afford the luxury, and if milk is
provided to drink with it. They can cook a
little portion in a tin enamelled cup, and so escape
the family saucepan.</p>

<p>Another difficulty which dogs the path of the
Lambeth housekeeper is, either that there is no
oven or only a gas oven which requires a good
deal of gas, or that the stove oven needs much
fuel to heat it. Once a week, for the Sunday
dinner, the plunge is taken. Homes where there
is no oven send out to the bakehouse on that
occasion. The rest of the week is managed on
cold food, or the hard-worked saucepan and
frying-pan are brought into play. The certainty
of an economical stove or fireplace is out of the
reach of the poor. They are often obliged to use
old-fashioned and broken ranges and grates which
devour coal with as little benefit to the user as
possible. They are driven to cook by gas, which
ought to be an excellent way of cooking, but
under the penny-in-the-slot system it is a way
which tends to underdone food.</p>

<p>Table appointments are never sufficient. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
children hardly sit down to any meal but dinner,
and even then they sometimes stand round the
table for lack of chairs. Some women have a
piece of oilcloth on the table; some spread a newspaper.
So many plates are put round, each containing
a dinner. The eating takes no time at
all. A drink of water out of a tea-cup which is
filled for each child in turn finishes the repast.</p>

<p>Equipment for cleaning is one of the elastic
items in a budget. A Lambeth mother would
like to spend 5d. on soap, 1d. on soda, 1d. on blue
and starch. She is obliged in many cases to
compress the expenditure to 3d. or 5d. all told.
She sometimes has to make 2d. do. There is the
remains of a broom sometimes. Generally there
is only a bucket and a cloth, which latter, probably,
is the quite hopelessly worn-out shirt or pinafore
of a member of the family. One woman heard of
soda which could be bought in The Walk for less
than the traditional 7 pounds for 3d., and, in
her great economy, supplied her house with this
inferior kind. She scrubbed and washed and
cleaned with it till her poor arms lost all their
skin, and she was taken into the workhouse infirmary
with dangerous blood-poisoning. There
she stayed for many weeks, while sisters and
sisters-in-law took care of her children at a slight
charge for mere food, and the husband, who was
earning steady wages, looked after himself. He
said it was more expensive without her than with
her, and never rested till he got her home again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The cleaning of the house is mostly done in the
afternoons, when dinner is disposed of. Scrubbing,
grate-cleaning, bed-making, are attended to after
the return to school and to work of the children
and husband. The baby and ex-baby are persuaded
to sleep then, if possible, while the mother, with due
regard to economy of soap, cleans out her little
world. She has hardly finished before the children
are back for tea, and after tea the washing up.</p>

<p>Two pennyworth of soap may have to wash the
clothes, scrub the floors, and wash the people of
a family, for a week. It is difficult to realise the
soap famine in such a household. Soda, being
cheap, is made to do a great deal. It sometimes
appears in the children’s weekly bath; it often
washes their hair. A woman who had been using
her one piece of soap to scrub the floor next
brought it into play when she bathed the baby,
with the unfortunate result of a long scratch on
the baby from a cinder in the soap. She sighed
when the visitor noticed the scratch, and said: “I
sometimes think I’d like a little oven best, but now
it do seem as if I’d rather ’ave two bits of soap.”
The visitor helpfully suggested cutting the one
piece in two, but the mother shook her experienced
head, and said: “It wouldn’t last not ’arf as long.”</p>

<p>Clothing is, frankly, a mystery. In the budgets
of some women 6d. a week is set down opposite
the item “clothing club” or “calico club.”
This seems meant to provide for underclothing—chiefly
flannelette. One shilling is down, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
against “boot club.” Other provision in the
most thrifty family there seems to be none. A
patient visitor may extract information, perhaps,
that the father gets overtime pay at Christmas,
and applies some of it to the children’s clothes,
or that he is in a paying-out club which produces
anything from 13s. to 26s., or thereabouts, at the
end of the year. But in the great number of cases
there is no extra money at Christmas, or at any
other time, to depend upon. In the poorer budgets
items for clothes appear at extraordinary distant
intervals, when, it is to be supposed, they can no
longer be done without. “Boots mended” in
the weekly budget means less food for that week,
while any clothes which are bought seem to be
not only second-hand, but in many instances
fourth- or fifth-hand. In the course of fifteen
months’ visiting, one family on 23s. a week spent
£3 5s. 5½d. on clothes for the mother and six
children. Half the sum was spent on boots, so
that the clothes other than boots of seven people
cost 32s. 9d. in fifteen months—an average of
4s. 8d. a head. Another family spent 9d. a week
on boots and 9d. a week on clothes in general.
There were four children. Some families, again,
only buy clothes when summer comes and less is
needed for fuel. The clubs to which extra careful
women, or women with more money for housekeeping,
subscribe, are generally run by a small
local tradesman. Whether they work for the
benefit of their clients, or whether, as seems far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
more likely, they are run entirely in the interests
of the proprietors, has not been a subject of research
for the investigation. They fill a want.
That is evident. Women bringing up a family
on 20s. or even more a week need to have a
definite expenditure in order to know where they
are. They like to buy the same things week after
week, because then they can calculate to a nicety
how the money will last. They like to do their
saving in the same way. So much a week regularly
paid has a great attraction for them. If the
club will, in addition to small regular payments,
send someone to call for the amount, the transaction
leaves nothing to be desired. A woman who
can see her way towards the money by any possibility
agrees at once. Payment by instalment
fascinates the poor for the same reason. It is a
regular amount which they can understand and
grasp, and the awful risk, if misfortune occurs
of losing the precious article, together with such
payments as have already been made, does not
inflame their imaginations. If people living on
£1 a week had lively imaginations, their lives, and
perhaps the face of England, would be different.</p>

<p>Boots form by far the larger part of clothing
expenses in a family of poor children. Most
fathers in Lambeth can sole a little boot with some
sort of skill. One man, a printer’s handyman,
spends some time every day over the boots of his
children. He is a steady, intelligent man, and
he says it takes him all his spare time. As soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
as he has gone round the family the first pair is
ready again. The women seldom get new clothes;
boots they often are entirely without. The men
go to work and must be supplied, the children
must be decent at school, but the mother has no
need to appear in the light of day. If very badly
equipped, she can shop in the evening in The
Walk, and no one will notice under her jacket
and rather long skirt what she is wearing on her
feet. Most of them have a hat, a jacket, and a
“best” skirt, to wear in the street. In the house
a blouse and a patched skirt under a sacking
apron is the universal wear. Some of the women
miraculously manage to look clean and tidy;
some do not. The astonishing difference made
by a new pink blouse, becomingly-done hair, and
a well-made skirt, on one drab-looking woman
who seemed to be about forty was too startling
to forget. She suddenly looked thirty (her age
was twenty-six), and she had a complexion and
quite pretty hair—features never noticed before.
These women who look to be in the dull middle
of middle age are young; it comes as a shock
when the mind grasps it.</p>

<p>In connection with clothing comes the vexed
question of flannelette. To a mother, they all use
it. It is warm, soft, and cheap. The skirts for
two children’s petticoats can be bought for 4d.—the
bodies, too, if the children are tiny and skill
is used. What else can the women buy that will
serve its purpose as well? It is inflammable—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
mothers know that, but they hope to escape
accident—and it is cheap enough to buy. Better,
they think, a garment of flannelette than no garment
at all! They would use material which is
not inflammable if there were any they could
afford which is as warm and soft and unshrinkable
as flannelette. The shops to which their calico
clubs belong stock flannelettes of all the most
cheap and useful and inflammable kinds. Flannel,
merino, cashmere, woollen material of any kind,
are dear in comparison. Enough unshrinkable
stuff to make a child a new warm, soft dress can
be bought for 6d. A woman with 6d. to spend
will buy that stuff rather than let her child go
without the dress. It is what we should all do
in her place. A child must be dressed. Give any
London magistrate 6d. a week on which to dress
four children; give him a great deal of cooking,
scrubbing, and housework, to do; put a flannelette
shop round the corner: in exactly four weeks each
of those children would be clothed in flannelette.</p>

<p>The difficulty of keeping windows open at night;
the impossibility—with the best will in the world—of
bathing children more than once a week;
the hasty and inadequate cooking in worn-out
and cheap utensils; the clumsy, hampering, and
ill-arranged clothing—all these things, combined
with the housing conditions described in the previous
chapter, show how difficult is the path of the
woman entrusted, on a few shillings a week, with
the health and lives of a number of future citizens.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">THRIFT</span></h2>

<p>It is just that a short chapter should be devoted
to the thrift of such a class of wage-earners and
their wives as are described here. It is a common
idea that there is no thrift among them. It
would be better for their children if this were true.
As a matter of fact, sums varying from 6d. a week
to 1s. 6d., 1s. 8d., or even 2s., go out from incomes
which are so small that these sums represent,
perhaps, from 2½ to 10 per cent. of the whole
household allowance. The object of this thrift
is, unfortunately, not of the slightest benefit to
the children of the families concerned. The
money is spent or saved or invested, whichever
is the proper term, on burial insurance. No
living child is better fed or better clothed because
its parents, decent folk, scrape up a penny a
week to pay the insurance collector on its account.
Rather is it less well fed and less well
clothed to the extent of 1d. a week—an appreciable
amount when it is, perhaps, one of eight
persons living on £1 a week.</p>

<p>One of the criticisms levelled at these respectable,
hard-working, independent people is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
they do like to squander money on funerals. It
is a view held by everyone who does not know
the real circumstances. It is also held by many
who do know them, but who confuse the fact
that poor people show a great interest in one
another’s funerals with the erroneous idea that
they could bury their dead for half the amount
if they liked. Sometimes, in the case of adult
men, this may be so. When alive, the man,
perhaps, was a member of a society for burial
benefit, and at his death the club or society bury
him with much pomp and ceremony. In the
case of the young children of people living on
from 18s. to 30s. a week, the parents do not
squander money on funerals which might be
undertaken for half the price.</p>

<p>A working man and his wife who have a family
are confronted with the problem of burial at once.
They are likely to lose one or more of their
children. The poorer they are, the more likely
are they to lose them. Shall they run the risk
of burial by the parish, or shall they take Time
by the forelock and insure each child as it is born,
at the rate of a penny a week? If they decide
not to insure, and they lose a child, the question
resolves itself into one of borrowing the sum
necessary to pay the funeral expenses, or of
undergoing the disgrace of a pauper funeral.
The pauper funeral carries with it the pauperization
of the father of the child—a humiliation
which adds disgrace to the natural grief of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
parents. More than that, they declare that the
pauper funeral is wanting in dignity and in respect
to their dead. One woman expressed the feeling
of many more when she said she would as soon
have the dust-cart call for the body of her child
as that “there Black Mariar.” This may be
sheer prejudice on the part of poor parents, but
it is a prejudice which richer parents—even the
most educated and highly born of them—if confronted
with the same problem when burying
their own children, would fully share. Refusing,
then, if uninsured, to accept the pauper burial,
with its consequent political and social degradation
of a perfectly respectable family, the parents
try to borrow the money needed. Up and down
the street sums are collected in pence and sixpences,
until the price of a child’s funeral on the
cheapest scale is secured. Funerals are not run
on credit; but the neighbours, who may be absolute
strangers, will contribute rather than suffer
the degradation to pauperism of one of themselves.
For months afterwards the mother and
remaining children will eat less in order to pay
back the money borrowed. The father of the
family cannot eat less. He is already eating as
little as will enable him to earn the family wage.
To starve him would be bad economy. He must
fare as usual. The rest of the family can eat less
without bothering anybody—and do.</p>

<p>What is the sum necessary to stand between a
working man and pauperdom should he suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the loss of a child? Inquiry among undertakers
in Lambeth and Kennington resulted in the discovery
that a very young baby could be buried
by one undertaker for 18s., and by a dozen others
for 20s. To this must be added the fee of 10s.
to the cemetery paid by the undertaker, which
brought his charges up to 28s. or 30s. No firm
could be discovered who would do it for less.
When a child’s body is too long to go under the
box-seat of the driver, the price of the funeral goes
up. A sort of age scale is roughly in action,
which makes a funeral of a child of three more
expensive than that of a child of six months.
Thirty shillings, then, is the lowest sum to be
faced by the grieving parents. But how is a man
whose whole weekly income may be but two-thirds
of that amount to produce at sight 30s.
or more? Of course he cannot. Sheer dread of
the horrible problem drives his wife to pay out
10d., 11d., or 1s., a week year after year—money
which, as far as the welfare of the children themselves
go, might as well be thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>A penny a week paid from birth just barely
pays the funeral expenses as the child grows older.
It does not completely pay them in early infancy.
Thirteen weekly pennies must be paid before any
benefit is due, and the first sum due is not sufficient;
but it is a help. As each child must be
insured separately, the money paid for the child
who does not die is no relief when a death occurs.
Insurance, whether State or other insurance, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
always a gamble, and people on £1 a week cannot
afford a gamble. A peculiar hardship attaches
to burial insurance. A man may have paid
regularly for years, may fall out of work through
illness or other misfortune, and may lose all
benefit. When out of work his children are more
likely to die, and he may have to suffer the disgrace
of a pauper funeral after five years or more
of regular payment for burial insurance.</p>

<p>Great numbers of premature confinements
occur among women who live the lives these wives
and mothers do. A premature confinement, if
the child breathes, means an uninsured funeral.
True, an undertaker will sometimes provide a
coffin which he slips into another funeral, evade
the cemetery fee, and only charge 10s.; but even
10s. is a terrible sum to produce at the moment.
Great is the anxiety on the part of the mother to
be able to prove that her child was stillborn.</p>

<p>The three-year-old daughter of a carter out of
work died of tuberculosis. The father, whose
policies had lapsed, borrowed the sum of £2 5s.
necessary to bury the child. The mother was four
months paying the debt off by reducing the food
of herself and of the five other children. The
funeral cortège consisted of one vehicle, in which
the little coffin went under the driver’s seat.
The parents and a neighbour sat in the back part
of the vehicle. They saw the child buried in a
common grave with twelve other coffins of all
sizes. “We ’ad to keep a sharp eye out for Edie,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
they said; “she were so little she were almost
’id.”</p>

<p>The following is an account kept of the funeral
of a child of six months who died of infantile
cholera in the deadly month of August, 1911.
The parents had insured her for 2d. a week, being
unusually careful people. The sum received was
£2.</p>

<p>The child was buried in a common grave with
three others. There is no display and no extravagance
in this list. The tips to the gravediggers,
hearse attendants, and insurance agent, were all
urgently applied for, though not in every case by
the person who received the money. The cost
of the child’s illness had amounted to 10s.,
chiefly spent on special food. The survivors
lived on reduced rations for two weeks in order
to get square again. The father’s wage was 24s.,
every penny of which he always handed over to his
wife.</p>

<p>The usual amount paid for burial insurance is
1d. a week for each child, 2d. for the mother, and
3d. for the father, making 11d. a week for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
family with six children, though some over-cautious
women make the sum more.</p>

<p>Another form of thrift is some sort of paying-out
club. Usually payments of this kind come out
of the father’s pocket-money, but a few instances
where the women made them came within the
experience of the investigators. One club was
named a “didly club.” Its method seemed to
consist in each member paying a certain woman
¼d. the first week, ½d. the next week, ¾d. the next
week, and so on, always adding ¼d. to the previous
payment. The money was to be divided
at Christmas. It was a mere way of saving, as no
interest of any kind was to be paid. Needless to
relate, about October the woman to whom the
money had been paid disappeared. Stocking
clubs, crockery clubs, and Christmas dinner clubs,
make short appearances in the budgets. They
usually entail a weekly payment of 3d. or 4d.,
and when the object—the children’s winter
stockings, the new plates, or the Christmas
dinner—has been attained, the payments cease.</p>

<p>One form of money transaction which is
hardly regarded as justifiable when poor people
resort to it, but which at the same time is the
ordinary, laudable, business custom of rich men—namely,
borrowing—is carried on by the poor
under very distressing conditions. When no friend
or friends can be found to help at a crisis, many
a woman has been driven—perhaps to pay the rent—to
go to what she calls a lender. A few shillings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
are borrowed—perhaps five or six. The terms
are a penny a week on every shilling borrowed,
with, it may be, a kind of tip of half a crown at
the end when all the principle and interest has
been paid off. A woman borrowing 6s. pays 6d.
a week in sheer interest—that is, £1 6s. a year—without
reducing her debt a penny. She is paying
433 per cent. on her loan. She does not
know the law, and she could not afford to invoke
its aid if she did know it. She goes on being bled
because it is the local accepted rate of a “lender.”
Only one of the women whose budgets appear
in these pages has had recourse to this kind
of borrowing, but the custom is well known by
them all.</p>

<p>Such is the passion for weekly regular payments
among these women that, had the Post
Office initiated regular collection of pennies instead
of the industrial insurance companies doing
so, either the Post Office would now be in possession
of the enormous accumulated capital of these
companies, or the people on 20s. a week would
have been much better off. The great bulk of
the pennies so urgently needed for other purposes,
and paid for burial insurance, is never returned in
any form whatsoever to the people who pay them.
The small proportion which does come to them is
swallowed up in a burial, and no one but the
undertaker is the better for it. As a form of
thrift which shall help the future, or be a standby
if misfortune should befall, burial insurance is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
calamitous blunder. Yet the respectable poor
man is forced to resort to it unless he is to run
the risk of being made a pauper by any bereavement
which may happen to him. It is a terrible
object lesson in how not to manage. If the
sum of £11,000,000 a year stated to be paid in
weekly pennies by the poor to the industrial burial
insurance companies were to be spent on better
house room and better food—if, in fact, the one
great universal thrift of the poor were not for
death, but were for life—we should have a stronger
nation. The only real solution of this horrible
problem would seem to be the making of decent
burial a free and honourable public service.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">BUDGETS</span></h2>

<p>Perhaps it will be as well here to reiterate the
statement that these chapters are descriptive of
the lives and conditions of families where the
wage of the father is continuous, where he is a
sober, steady man in full work, earning from 18s.
to 30s. a week, and allowing a regular definite
sum to his wife for all expenses other than his
own clothes, fares, and pocket-money. Experience
shows how fatally easy it is for people to
label all poverty as the result of drink, extravagance,
or laziness. It is done every day in the
year by writers and speakers and preachers, as
well as by hundreds of well-meaning folk with
uneasy consciences. They see, or more often
hear of, people whose economy is different from
their own. Without trying to find out whether
their own ideas of economy are practicable for
the people in question, they dismiss their poverty
as “the result of extravagance” or drink. Then
they turn away with relief at the easy explanation.
Or they see or hear of something which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
seems to them bad management. It may be,
not good management, but the only management
under the circumstances. But, as the circumstances
are unknown, the description serves, and
middle-class minds, only too anxious to be set at
rest, are set at rest. Drink is an accusation
fatally easy to throw about. By suggesting it
you account for every difficulty, every sorrow.
A man who suffers from poverty is supposed to
drink. That he has 18s. or 20s. a week, and a
family to bring up upon that income, is not considered
evidence of want. People who have
never spent less than £4 a week on themselves
alone will declare that a clever managing woman
can make 18s. or 20s. a week go as far as an
ordinary woman, not a good manager, will make
30s. They argue as though the patent fact
that 30s. misspent may reduce its value to 18s.
could make 18s. a week enough to rear a family
upon. It is not necessary to invoke the agency
of drink to make 20s. a week too small a sum
for the maintenance of four, five, six, or more,
persons. That some men in possession of this
wage may drink does not make it a sufficient
wage for the families of men who do not
drink.</p>

<p>It is now possible to begin calculations as to
the expenditure of families of various sizes on a
given wage or household allowance. For a family
with six children the rent is likely to be 8s., 8s. 6d.,
or even 9s., for three or four rooms. A woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with one or two children sometimes manages, by
becoming landlady, to make advantageous arrangements
with lodgers, and so reduce her payments,
though not her risk, to considerably less
than the usual market price of one or two fairly
good rooms. But women with large families are
not able to do this. A family with four or five
children may manage in two rooms at a rental of
6s. to 7s., while a family with one, two, three
or even occasionally four, children will take one
room, paying from 3s. 6d. up to 5s., according to
size. It is safe to assume that a man with a wife
and six children and a wage of 24s. a week will
allow 22s. for all outgoings other than his own
clothes and pocket-money, and that his wife will
pay for three, or perhaps four, rooms the sum of
8s. a week.</p>

<p>The other regular items in such a woman’s budget,
apart from food, would be heating and lighting,
comprising coal, wood, matches, gas or oil, and
candles. The irregular items include doctor’s visits
to a sick child, which may cost 6d. a visit, or 1s.
a visit, including medicine, and renewals which
may be provided for by “crockery club, 4d.,” or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
may appear as “teapot, 6d.,” or “jug, 3¾d.,” at
rare intervals.</p>

<p>Coal is another necessary for which the poor
pay a larger price than the well-to-do. The
Lambeth woman is compelled to buy her coal by
the hundredweight for two reasons, the chief of
which is that she is never in possession of a
sum of ready money sufficient to buy it by the
ton or by the half-ton. A few women, in their
passion for regular weekly payments, make an
arrangement with the coalman to leave 1 cwt.
of coal every week throughout the year, for
which they pay a settled price. In the summer
the coal, if they are lucky enough to have room
to keep it, accumulates. One such woman came
through the coal strike without paying anything
extra. She used only ½ cwt. a week from the
coalman, and depended for the rest upon her
store. But not all have the power to do this,
because they have nowhere to keep their coal but
a box on the landing or a cupboard beside the
fireplace. They therefore pay in an ordinary
winter 1s. 6d. a cwt., except for any specially cold
spell, when they may pay 1s. 7d. or 1s. 8d. for a
short time; and in the summer they probably pay
8d. or 8½d. for ½ cwt. a week. In districts of London
where the inhabitants are rich enough to buy
coal by the ton, the same quality as is used in
Lambeth can be bought in an ordinary winter—even
now, when the price is higher than it used to
be—for 22s. 6d. a ton, with occasional short rises to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
23s. 6d. in very cold weather. Householders who
have a large cellar space have been able to buy the
same quality of coal which the Lambeth people
burn, in truck loads, at the cheap time of year, at a
price of about 20s. a ton. The Lambeth woman
who buys by the hundredweight deems herself
lucky. Only those in regular work can always do
that. Some people, poorer still, are driven to buy
it by the 14 lbs. in bags which they fetch home
themselves. For this they pay a higher proportionate
price still. While, therefore, it has been
in the power of the rich man to buy cheap coal
at £1 a ton, the poor man has paid 30s. a ton in
winter, and almost 27s. in summer—a price for
which the rich man could and did get his best
quality silkstone.</p>

<p>Wood may cost 2d. a week, or in very parsimonious
hands 1d. is made to do. Gas, by the
penny-in-the-slot system, is used rather more for
cooking than lighting. The expense in such a
family as that under consideration would be
about 1s.</p>

<p>The whole amount of the household allowance
was supposed to be 22s. The amount left for
food therefore would be 8s. 7d. in a week when no
irregular and therefore extra expense, such as a
doctor’s visit or a new teapot, is incurred. This
reasoned calculation of expenses other than food
has been built up from the actual personal knowledge
of the visitors in the investigation—from

<p>This family spent extraordinarily little upon
coal, and less than the usual amount on gas.
Their great extravagance was in burial insurance.
The extra penny on each child was not to bring a
larger payment at death, but to provide a small
sum at the age of fourteen with which to start
the child in life. A regular provision of 6d. for
other clothing than boots was made when the
household allowance rose to 21s. 9d. on January 6,
1911.</p>

<p>Mr. B., printer’s warehouseman, jobbing hand.
Average wage 23s. Allows 20s. Four children.</p>

<p>August 18, 1910, allowed 20s.</p>

<p>No gas was laid on in the house. The item
for coal, therefore, is moderate, as most women pay
1s. 6d. for 1 cwt. of coal a week in cold weather,
besides paying 10d. or 1s. for gas. Boots are
paid for when required. A note against the
budget for April 13 says: “Sole old pram for 3s.
it was to litle. Bourt boots for Siddy for

<p class="center">Left for food 9s. 4d.</p>

<p>In this family there is no regular provision for
clothes, which are paid for as they must be bought.
No extra money is at any time of the year forthcoming.
Mr. S. clothes himself, but extracts
from his wife his newspaper as well as his fares.
The latter are usually paid by the men. The
mother is an excellent needlewoman, and makes
nearly all the children’s clothes. She is also a
wonderful manager, and her two rooms are as
clean as a new pin. This had not prevented her
from losing five children when these particular
budgets were taken. She soon after lost a sixth.
The rent is far too low for healthy rooms. Though
she pays for the same number of rooms as Mrs. L.,
she pays 1s. 6d. less a week for them, and they are
wretchedly inferior. Her burial insurance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
extremely high. Her record shows that she
thought herself wise to make the sum so liberal.
Even then she had to borrow 10s. to help to pay
the 30s. for the funeral of her last child, because
the burial insurance money only amounted
to £1.</p>

<p>All the women, with the exception of Mrs. K.,
are notable managers, and all but Mrs. K. and
Mrs. P. are extremely tidy and clean. Mrs. K.,
who has five sons and a daughter, is more happy-go-lucky
than the others, as, fortunately for her,
her husband “can’t abide ter see the ’ouse bein’
cleaned,” and when it is clean “likes to mess it all
up agen.” Mrs. K. doesn’t go in for worryin’ the
boys, either. Her eldest child is Louie, the only
girl, who is thirteen, and rather good at school,
but doesn’t do much to help at home, as Mrs. K.
likes to see her happy. With all her casual ways,
Mrs. K. has a delicate mind, and flushes deeply
if the visitor alludes to anything which shocks
her. Louie’s bed is shared by only one small
brother; Louie’s clothes are tidy, though Mr. and
Mrs. K. seem to sleep among a herd of boys, and
Mrs. K.’s skirt looks as though rats had been at
it, and her blouse is never where it should be at
the waist.</p>

<p>Mrs. P. is under thirty, and, when she has time
to look it, rather pretty. Her eldest child is
only ten. The tightest economy reigns in that
little house, partly because Mr. P. is a careful
man and very delicate, and partly because Mrs. P.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
is terrified of debt. It was she who discovered
the plan of buying seven cracked eggs for 3d.
As she said, it might lose you a little of the egg,
but you could smell it first, which was a convenience.
She is clean, but untidy, very gentle in
her manner, and as easily shocked as Mrs. K.
Her mother rents one of her rooms, and, much
beloved, is always there to advise in an unscientific,
inarticulate, but soothing way when there is
a difficulty. The children are fair and delicate,
and are kept clean by their tired little mother,
who plaintively declared that she preferred boys
to girls, because you could cut their hair off and
keep their heads clean without trouble, and also
because their nether garments were less easily
torn. When in the visitor’s presence the little
P.’s have swallowed a hasty dinner, which may
consist of a plateful of “stoo,” or perhaps of
suet pudding and treacle, taken standing, they
never omit to close their eyes and say, “Thang
Gord fer me good dinner—good afternoon, Mrs.
R.” before they go. Mrs. P. would call them all
back if they did not say that.</p>

<p>Mrs. B. is a manager who could be roused at
any moment in the night and inform the inquirer
exactly what money she had in her purse, and
how many teaspoonfuls of tea were left, before she
properly opened her eyes. She likes to spend
exactly the same sum on exactly the same article,
and the same amount of it, every week. Her
menus are deplorably monotonous—never a flight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
into jam, when the cheapest “marge” goes
farther! Never an exciting sausage, but always
stew of “pieces” on Wednesday and stew
warmed up on Thursday. When bread goes up
it upsets her very much. It gives her quite a
headache trying to take the exact number of
farthings out of other items of expenditure without
upsetting her balance. She loved keeping
accounts. It was a scheme which fell in with the
bent of her mind, and, though she is no longer
visited, she is believed to keep rigorous accounts
still. She and all her family are delicate. Her
height is about 5 feet, and when the visitor
first saw her, and asked if Mr. B. were a big man,
she replied, “Very big, miss—’e’s bigger than
me.” She was gentle with children, and liked
to explain to a third person their constant and
mysterious symptoms. She dressed tidily, if
drably, and always wore a little grey tippet or a
man’s cap on her head.</p>

<p>Mrs. L. is older and larger and more gaunt—a
very silent woman. Mr. L. talks immensely, and
takes liberties with her which she does not seem
to notice. She is gentle and always tidy, always
clean, and very depressed in manner. When her
baby nearly died with double pneumonia, she sat
up night after night, nursed him and did all the
work of the house by day, but all she ever said on
the subject was, “I’d not like ter lose ’im now.”
She looked more gaunt as the days went on, but
everything was done as usual. When the baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
recovered she made no sign. Before marriage
she had been a domestic servant in a West-End
club, receiving 14s. a week and all found. Her
savings furnished the home and bought clothes
for some years.</p>

<p>Mrs. S. could tell you a little about Mr. S. if
you pressed her. He was a “good ’usbin’,” but
not desirable on Saturday nights. She was a
worn, thin woman with a dull, slow face, but an
extraordinary knack of keeping things clean and
getting things cheap. All her bread was fetched
by her eldest boy of thirteen from the back door
of a big restaurant once a week. It lived in a
large bag hung on a nail behind the door, and
got very stale towards the end of the week; but it
was good bread. She could get about 100 broken
rolls for 1s. 9d. When she lost her children she
cried a very little, but went about much as usual,
saying, if spoken to on the subject, “I done all I
could.’ E ’ad everythink done fer ’im,” which
was perfectly true as far as she was concerned,
and in so far as her means went. She loved her
family in a patient, suffering, loyal sort of way
which cannot have been very exhilarating for
them.</p>

<p>All of these women, with, perhaps, the exception
of Mrs. K., seemed to have lost any spark of
humour or desire for different surroundings. The
same surroundings with a little more money, a
little more security, and a little less to do, was
about the best their imaginations could grasp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
They knew nothing of any other way of living if
you were married. Mrs. K. liked being read to.
Her husband, hearing that she had had “Little
Lord Fauntleroy” read aloud to her at her
mothers’ meeting, took her to the gallery of a
theatre, where she saw acted some version, or
what she took for some version, of this story. It
roused her imagination in a way which was
astonishing. She questioned, she believed, she
accepted. There were people like that! How
real and how thrilling! It seemed to take something
of the burden of the five boys and the girl
from her shoulders. Did the visitor think theatres
wrong? No, the visitor liked theatres. Well,
Mrs. K. would like to go again if it could possibly
be afforded, but of course it could not. At the
mothers’ meeting they were now having a book
read to them called “Dom Quick Sotty.” It was
interesting, but not so interesting as “Little Lord
Fauntleroy,” though, of course, that would be
Mrs. K.’s own fault most probably. Mrs. K.’s
criticism on “Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch,”
later, was that it was a book about a queer sort of
people.</p>

<p>The children of these five families were, on the
whole, well brought up as regards manners and
cleanliness and behaviour. All of them were
kindly and patiently treated by their mothers.
Mrs. P., who was only twenty-eight, was a little
plaintive with her brood of six. Mrs. K., as has
been explained, was unruffled and placid. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
other three were punctual, clean, and gentle, if a
trifle depressing. Want of the joy of life was the
most salient feature of the children as they grew
older. They too readily accepted limitations and
qualifications imposed upon them, without that
irrational hoping against impossibility and belief
in favourable miracles which carry more fortunate
children through many disappointments. These
children never rebel against disappointment. It
is their lot. They more or less expect it. The
children of Mrs. K. were the most vital and noisy
and troublesome, and those of Mrs. B. the most
obedient and quiet, and what the women themselves
called “old-fashioned.” All the children
were nice creatures, and not one of them was a
“first-class life” or gave promise of health and
strength.</p>

<p class="smaller mt1"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In dissecting budgets in this and following
chapters the writer has not reckoned in the extra
nourishment which was provided for mother and child.
It is obvious that general calculations based upon such
temporary and unusual assistance would be misleading
with regard to the whole class of low-paid labour.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">FOOD: CHIEF ARTICLES OF DIET</span></h2>

<p>We now come to food. Two questions, besides
that of the amount of money to be spent, bear
upon food. What are the chief articles of diet?
Where are they bought? Without doubt, the
chief article of diet in a 20s. budget is bread. A
long way after bread come potatoes, meat, and
fish. Bread is bought from one of the abundance
of bakers in the neighbourhood, and is not as a
rule very different in price and quality from bread
in other parts of London. Meat is generally bargained
for on street stalls on Saturday night or
even Sunday morning. It may be cheaper than
meat purchased in the West End, but is as certainly
worse in original quality as well as less fresh
and less clean in condition. Potatoes are generally
2 lbs. for 1d., unless they are “new” potatoes.
Then they are dearer. When, at certain seasons
in the year, they are “old” potatoes, they are
cheaper; but then they do not “cut up” well,
owing to the sprouting eyes. They are usually
bought from an itinerant barrow. Bread in
Lambeth is bought in the shop, because the baker
is bound, when selling over the counter, to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
legal weight. In other words, when he is paid for
a quartern he must sell a quartern. He therefore
weighs two “half-quartern” loaves, and makes
up with pieces of bread cut from loaves he keeps
by him for the purpose until the weight is correct.
In different districts bakers sell a quartern for
slightly different prices. The price at one moment
south of Kennington Park may be 5d.,
while up in Lambeth proper it may be 5½d. In
Kensington at the same moment delivered bread
is perhaps being sold at 6d. a quartern. The difference
in price, therefore, at a given moment might
amount to as much as 7d. a week in the case of a
large family, and 3d. in the case of a small family.</p>

<p>When a weekly income is decreased for any
cause, the one item of food which seldom varies—or
at any rate is the last to vary—is bread.
Meat is affected at once. Meat may sink from
4s. a week to 6d. owing to a fluctuation in income.
But the amount of bread bought when the full
allowance was paid is, if possible, still bought
when meat may have almost decreased to nothing.
The amount of bread eaten in an ordinary
middle-class, well-to-do, but economically managed
household of thirteen persons is 18 quarterns,
or 36 loaves, a week—something not far short of
3 loaves a head a week. This takes no heed of
innumerable cakes and sweet puddings consumed
by these thirteen persons, who at the same time
are consuming an ample supply of meat, fish,
bacon, fruit, vegetables, butter, and milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>In Lambeth, the amounts spent on bread and
meat respectively by the wives of four men in
regular work are given below:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">Mrs. D.: Allowance, 28s.; ten persons to feed;
10½ quartern at 5½d.; meat, 4s. 2d.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mrs. C.: Allowance, 21s.; eight persons to feed;
8½ quartern at 5½d.; meat, 3s. 2½d.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mrs. J.: Allowance, 22s.; five persons to feed;
7 quartern at 5½d.; meat, 2s. 11d.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mrs. G.: Allowance, 19s. 6d.; five persons to feed;
5½ quartern at 5½d.; meat, 2s. 2d.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be seen that a quartern a head a week is
the least amount taken in these four cases. On
the whole, it would be a fairly correct calculation
to allow this quantity as the amount aimed at as
a minimum in most lower working-class families.
The sum spent on meat may perhaps be greater
than the sum spent on bread. But meat goes by
the board before bread is seriously diminished,
should the income suffer. This the three cases
given here will show:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">Mrs. W.: Allowance, 23s.; eight persons to feed;
9½ quartern; meat, 3s. 9½d.</p>

<p class="hanging">Allowance reduced to 17s.; eight persons to feed;
8½ quartern; meat, 1s. 6d.</p>

<p class="hanging">Allowance reduced to 10s. (rent unpaid); eight
persons to feed; 6 quartern; meat, 6d.</p>

<p class="hanging mt1">Mrs. S.: Allowance, 21s.; eight persons to feed;
7 quartern; meat, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class="hanging">Allowance reduced to 18s.; eight persons to feed;
7 quartern; meat, 1s. 2d.</p>

<p class="hanging mt1">Mrs. M.: Allowance, 20s.; six persons to feed;
7 quartern; meat, 2s. 10d.</p>

<p class="hanging">Allowance reduced to 18s.; six persons to feed;
7 quartern; meat, 2s.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to arrive at the quantity of
meat, as it is often bargained for and sold by the
piece without weighing. The experienced housewife
offers so much, while the ticket on the meat is
offering it for so much more. A compromise is
arrived at and the commodity changes hands.
“Pieces” are sold by weight, but are of various
qualities and prices. Good “pieces” may be 6d.
per lb., fair “pieces” are sold for 4½d., which is
the most common price paid for them, but inferior
“pieces” can be had for 3d. on occasions. They
are usually gristle and sinew at that price.</p>

<p>Meat is bought for the men, and the chief expenditure
is made in preparation for Sunday’s
dinner, when the man is at home. It is eaten
cold by him the next day. The children get a
pound of pieces stewed for them during the week,
and with plenty of potatoes they make great show
with the gravy.</p>

<p>Bread, however, is their chief food. It is
cheap; they like it; it comes into the house ready
cooked; it is always at hand, and needs no plate
and spoon. Spread with a scraping of butter,
jam, or margarine, according to the length of
purse of the mother, they never tire of it as long
as they are in their ordinary state of health.
They receive it into their hands, and can please
themselves as to where and how they eat it. It
makes the sole article in the menu for two meals
in the day. Dinner may consist of anything,
from the joint on Sunday to boiled rice on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Friday. Potatoes will play a great part, as a rule,
at dinner, but breakfast and tea will be bread.</p>

<p>Potatoes are not an expensive item in the 20s.
budget. They may cost 1s. 3d. a week in a family
of ten persons, and 4d. a week in a family of three.
But they are an invariable item. Greens may go,
butter may go, meat may diminish almost to the
vanishing-point, before potatoes are affected.
When potatoes do not appear for dinner, their
place will be taken by suet pudding, which will
mean that there is no gravy or dripping to eat
with them. Treacle, or—as the shop round the
corner calls it—“golden syrup,” will probably
be eaten with the pudding, and the two together
will form a midday meal for the mother and
children in a working man’s family. All these
are good—bread, potatoes, suet pudding; but
children need other food as well.</p>

<p>First and foremost children need milk. All
children need milk, not only infants in arms.
When a mother weans her child, she ought to be
able to give it plenty of milk or food made with
milk. The writer well remembers a course of
eloquent and striking lectures delivered by an
able medical man to an audience of West-End
charitable ladies. He ended his course by telling
his audience that, if they wished to do good to the
children of the poor, they would do more towards
effecting their purpose if they were to walk
through East End streets with placards bearing
the legend “<span class="smcap">Milk</span> is the proper food for infants,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
than by taking any other action he could think
of. His audience was deeply interested and
utterly believing. The fact that the children of
the poor never taste milk once they cease to be
nursed by their mothers was well known to the
lecturer through his hospital experience, and
hence his earnest appeal to have the mothers of
those children taught what was the proper food
to give them. He was, however, wrong in his idea
that poor women do not realize that milk is the
proper food for infants. The reason why the
infants do not get milk is the reason why they do
not get good housing or comfortable clothing—it
is too expensive. Milk costs the same, 4d. a
quart, in Lambeth that it costs in Mayfair. A
healthy child ought to be able to use a quart of
milk a day, which means a weekly milk bill for
that child of 2s. 4d.—quite an impossible amount
when the food of the whole family may have to
be supplied out of 8s. or 9s. a week. Even a
pint a day means 1s. 2d. a week, so that is out
of the question, though a pint a day would not
suffice for a child of a year old, who would need
his or her full share of potatoes and gravy and
bread as well. As it is, the only milk the children
of the labourer get is the separated tinned milk,
sold in 1d., 2d., 3d., and 4d. tins, according to
size. These tins bear upon them in large red
letters the legend, “This milk is not recommended
as food for infants.” The children do not get
too much even of such milk. Families of ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
persons would take two tins at 3½d. in the week.
Families of five, six, or seven, would probably
take one such tin. It is used to put in tea, which,
as it is extremely sweet, it furnishes with sugar as
well as with milk. Sometimes it is spread on the
breakfast slice of bread instead of butter or jam.
An inexperienced visitor probably suggests that
it would make a good milk pudding, but is silenced
by hearing that it would take half a tin to make
one pudding, and then there is no richness in it.
Some people have suggested skim milk as a way
round this very terrible deprivation of the hard-working
poor. But skim milk does not take the
place of whole milk as a food for infants. Parents
who are comfortably off would never dream of
starving their infants upon it. Even supposing
that the children of the poor could magically
flourish upon skim milk alone, there is not enough
of it on the market to allow its use to be regarded
as a universal panacea for hungry babies. In
fact, it is worth a moment’s speculation as to
whether the whole milk-supply of England is
sufficient to insure a quart a day to each English
child under five years of age. It is more than
likely that, unless the milk-supply were enormously
increased, adults would have to go entirely
without milk should the nation suddenly awake
to its duty towards its children.</p>

<p>The purpose of this book is not to inquire as to
whether this mother or that mother might not do
a little better than she does if she bought some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
skim milk, or trained her children to enjoy burned
porridge. It is to inquire whether, under the
same conditions and with the same means at their
command, any body of men or women could
efficiently and sufficiently lodge and feed the same
number of children.</p>

<p>A boys’ home which maintains some thirty
children between the ages of six and fifteen feeds,
clothes, and lodges, each boy on an average of
6s. a week. This does not sound an extravagant
sum. It is the outcome of much study, great
knowledge of the subject, and untiring zeal.
The working man’s wife whose husband out of
a 22s. or 23s. wage allows her 20s., and who has
that convenient family of three children which
is permitted by experts on the subject to be a
becoming number in a working-class family, has
only 4s. a head on which to feed, lodge, and
clothe, the family.</p>

<p>Milk depots have been in existence in Lambeth
for some years, and have undoubtedly done
splendid service to babies under one year of age
whose mothers cannot nurse them, but can afford
to pay the growing amount of 9d. to 3s. a week
for their children. The milk has to be called for,
which limits the area in which it can be supplied;
but it is sent out in sealed vessels, and is mixed in
the exact proportions suitable to the age of the
infant. So, when it can be afforded, its results
are excellent. Unfortunately, the nursing mother
is not helped by this, and it is she who requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
milk for the needs of the baby she is nursing.
Moreover, the price is, in the case of the 20s.
budget, quite out of the question should the
children number more than one, or at the most two.</p>

<p>As things are, once weaned, the child of a
labouring man gets its share of the family diet.
It gets its share of the 4d. tin of separated milk,
its share of gravy and potatoes, a sip of the cocoa
on which 3d. or 4d. a week may be spent for the
use of everyone, and, if its father be particularly
partial to it, a mouthful of fat bacon once or
twice a week, spared from the not too generous
“relish to his tea.” Besides these extras it gets
bread.</p>

<p>Women in the poorer working-class districts
nurse their babies, as a rule, far longer than they
should. It is not unusual for a mother to say
that she always nurses until they are a year old.
In many cases where a better-off mother would
recognize that she is unable to satisfy her child’s
hunger, and would wean it at once, the poor
mother goes hopelessly on because it is cheaper to
nurse. It is less trouble to nurse, and it is held
among them to be a safeguard against pregnancy.
For those three reasons it is difficult to persuade
a Lambeth woman to wean her child. In most of
these cases milk or palatable food supplied to the
mother would save the situation, and contrive a
double debt to pay—the welfare of both mother
and child. But the mother, who is by nature a
poor nurse, usually finds, when she “gets about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
again,” that her milk deserts her, and the grave
difficulty of rearing the baby is met by her with
a weekly 5d. tin of milk of a brand which has not
been separated, but which is a very inadequate
quantity for an infant.</p>

<p>The articles of diet other than bread, meat,
potatoes (with occasional suet puddings and
tinned milk), are fish, of which a shilling’s worth
may be bought a week, and of which quite half
will go to provide the bread-winner with “relishes,”
while the other half may be eaten by the
mother and children; bacon, which will be entirely
consumed by the man; and an occasional egg.
The tiny amounts of tea, dripping, butter, jam,
sugar, and greens, may be regarded rather in the
light of condiments than of food.</p>

<p>The diet where there are several children is
obviously chosen for its cheapness, and is of the
filling, stodgy kind. There is not enough of anything
but bread. There is no variety. Nothing
is considered but money.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">BUYING, STORING, AND CARING FOR FOOD</span></h2>

<p>The place where food is bought is important.
How it is bought and when are also important
questions. The usual plan for a Lambeth housekeeper
is to make her great purchase on Saturday
evening when she gets her allowance. She probably
buys the soap, wood, oil, tea, sugar, margarine,
tinned milk, and perhaps jam, for the
week. To these she adds the Sunday dinner,
which means a joint or part of a joint, greens, and
potatoes. The bread she gets daily, also the
rasher, fish, or other relish, for her husband’s
special use. Further purchases of meat are made,
if they are made, about Wednesday, while potatoes
and pot herbs, as well as fish, often come
round on barrows, and are usually bought as required.
When she has put aside the rent, the insurance,
the boot club money, and spent the Saturday
night’s five or six shillings, she keeps the pennies
for the gas-meter and the money for the little
extras in some kind of purse or private receptacle
which lives within reach of her hand. A woman,
during the time she is laid up at her confinement,
will sleep with her purse in her hand or under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
pillow, and during the daytime she doles out with
an anxious heart the pennies for gas or the two-pences
for father’s relish. She generally complains
bitterly that the neighbour who is “doing” for
her has a heavy hand with the margarine, and no
conscience with the tea or sugar.</p>

<p>The regular shopping is monotonous. The
order at the grocer’s shop is nearly always the
same, as is also that at the oilman’s. The Sunday
dinner requires thought, but tends to repeat
itself with the more methodical housewife, who
has perhaps a leaning towards neck of mutton as
the most interesting of the cheaper joints, or
towards a half-shoulder as cutting to better advantage.
It is often the same dinner week
after week—one course of meat with greens and
potatoes. Some women indulge in flights of
fancy, and treat the family to a few pounds of fat
bacon at 6d. per pound, a quality which is not to
be recommended, or even to the extravagance of a
rabbit and onions for a change. These women
would be likely to vary the vegetables too; and in
their accounts tomatoes, when tomatoes are cheap,
may appear. It is only in the budgets of the
very small family, however, that such extravagant
luxuries would creep in.</p>

<p>In households where there is but one room
there may be no storage space at all. Coal may
be kept in the one cupboard on the floor beside
the fireplace; or there may be such hoards of
mice in the walls that no place is safe for food but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a basin with a plate over it. One woman when
lying in bed early in the morning unravelled a
mystery which had puzzled her for weeks. She
had not been able to find out how the food she
kept on a high shelf of the dresser was being got
at by mice. On the morning in question her
eye was caught by movements which appeared
to her to be in the air above her head. To her
surprise, she realized that a long procession of mice
was making use of her clothes-line to cross the
room and climb down the loose end on to the
high dresser shelf. They would, when satisfied,
doubtless have returned by the same route had
she not roused her husband. “But ’e ony terrified
’em,” she said sadly, “’e never caught one.”
In such cases it is necessary for the housekeeper
to buy all provisions other than tinned milk,
perhaps, day by day. She probably finds this
more extravagant—even to the extent of paying
more for the article. Tea, butter, and sugar, by
the ounce may actually cost more, and they
seldom go so far.</p>

<p>Another reason for buying all necessaries daily
is that many men, though in a perfectly regular
job (such as some kinds of carting), are paid daily,
as though they were casuals. The amounts vary,
moreover. One day they bring home 4s. 6d.,
another 3s. The housewife is never sure what
she will have to spend, and as the family needs
are, so must she supply necessaries out of the
irregular daily sum handed to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The daily purchases of the wife of a dustsorter
are given below. The husband was paid
3s. a day in cash, which he brought regularly to
his wife. He collected out of the material he
sorted, which came from the dustbins of Westminster,
enough broken bread to sell as pig-food
for a sum which paid both the rent and the burial
insurance. He also collected and brought home
each evening enough coal and cinders to supply
the family needs, and, curiously enough, he
collected and brought home a sufficiency of soap.
After paying 5s. for rent and 1s. for insurance,
he had enough left from these extra sources of
income for his own pocket-money. With rent,
insurance, coal, and soap, provided, the housekeeper
would have been well off indeed, as Lambeth
goes, could she have laid out her money to
better advantage. She never had more than
3s. at a time, and was accustomed to buy
everything day by day. There was but one
room. There were four children, who looked
stronger than they were. The mother suffered
from anæmia, and was not a particularly good
manager, though she fed her children fairly well
and seemed to be a moderately good cook. She
had no oven. An account of how she laid out
her 18s. is given on pp. 108, 109.</p>

<p>It is obvious that this is an extravagant way of
buying. Not only is the woman charged more
for some items, such as sugar and butter, which
she prefers to margarine even at the extra price,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
but the daily purchase leads to larger amounts
being used. Her husband is a teetotaller, but
likes strong tea, and that very sweet. Hence
12 ozs. of tea, 3 lbs. of sugar, and 3 tins of milk.
The baby was very young and the mother anæmic,
and the 8d. for a girl to take it out is money usefully
spent. Otherwise the infant would hardly
ever have left the room, as her mother does the
daily marketing when the baby is asleep. Since
this account was made out the authorities have
advised the family to take two rooms at an advanced
rental of 2s., of which the father and
mother each pay half. So the weekly list of purchases
has now to be made out of 17s. The
baby is six months old instead of five weeks, and
the mother’s milk has completely failed her.
Thus the expenses increase, while the housekeeping
allowance is less.</p>

<p>In the case of women who handle the whole
week’s wage at once, there is generally great need
of more cupboard space. Occasionally a scullery
helps to solve the problem, and there is often a
very shallow cupboard beside the chimney, high
enough from the floor to be clear of mice and
beetles, and out of reach of children. A kitchen
with the copper in it is a bad place for keeping
food; a kitchen infested with any kind of vermin
is also a bad place to keep food; a kitchen which
is plagued with flies is equally impossible. The
women whose lives are passed in such kitchens may
feel that, in spite of the extra expense and waste,
daily buying of perishable food is a necessity.</p>

<p>A woman with a sick child—one of six—living
in one room, was allowed milk for the use of the
child, who was extremely ill. The only place
where she could keep the milk was a basin with
an old piece of wet rag thrown over it. The
visitor found seven flies in the milk, and many
others crawling on the inner side of the rag. The
weather was stifling. The room, though untidy,
was tolerably clean. But over the senseless child
on the one bed in the room hovered a great cloud
of flies. The mother stood hour after hour brushing
them away. On the advice of the visitor the
sick child was carried off there and then to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
infirmary, where it ultimately recovered. Once
the child was removed, the flies ceased to swarm
into the room.</p>

<p>Cooking, which has already been mentioned in
connection with old and burnt saucepans and
utensils, is necessarily very perfunctory and rudimentary.
To boil a neck with pot herbs on
Sunday, and make a stew of “pieces” on Wednesday,
often finishes all that has to be done with
meat. The intermediate dinners will ring the
changes on cold neck, suet pudding, perhaps fried
fish or cheap sausages, and rice or potatoes.
Breakfast and tea, with the exception of the
husband’s relishes, consist of tea, and bread
spread with butter, jam, or margarine. In
houses where no gas is laid on, the gas-stove cannot
take the place of a missing oven, and it is
extraordinary how many one-roomed dwellings
are without an oven. Two pots, both burned, a
frying-pan, and a kettle, do not make an equipment
with which it is easy to manage the delicacies
of cooking. Boiling can be done in a burnt
saucepan, provided there is water enough in the
can which stands behind the door to fill the pot
sufficiently. Frying is held to be easy, but fat is
not plentiful, and frying in Lambeth usually
means frizzling in a very tiny amount of half-boiling
grease. The great panful of fat which
would be used by a good cook is impossible of
attainment. To stand by and watch the cooking
is difficult when so many things have to be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
at once. The pot, once placed on the fire or the
gas-stove, has to look after itself, while the mother
nurses a baby, or does a bit of washing, or tidies
the room and gets out the few plates which she
calls “laying the dinner.” The children all come
trooping in from school before she has finished, and
have to be scolded a little and told to get out of the
way, and when she has got them arranged sitting
or standing round the table she helps each one as
quickly and fairly as she can. If her husband is not
there, she may put aside his portion to be warmed
up and eaten later. She does not attempt to eat
with the family. She is server and provider, and
her work is to see that everyone gets a fair share,
according to his or her deserts and the merits of
the case. She may or may not sit down, but
perhaps with the baby in her arms she feeds the
youngest but one with potato and gravy or suet
pudding, whichever is the dinner of the day, for
fear it shall waste its food and spoil its clothes.
When the family have finished what she sets
before them, she sees to washing of hands where
the age of the washer is tender, and thankfully
packs them all off again to afternoon school,
having as likely as not called back the one who
banged the door to tell him to go out again and
“do it prop’ly.” The husband may not like his
dinner put aside for him, in which case a second
cooking is necessary. So much has to be done
each day. The Lambeth woman has no joy in
cooking for its own sake.</p>

<span class="smaller">ACTUAL MENUS OF SEVERAL WORKING
MEN’S FAMILIES</span></h2>

<p>The following is a week’s menu taken from Mrs.
X., the wife of a carter. His wages vary between
19s. and 23s. 6d., according to hours worked. In
a Bank Holiday week they went down to 15s.
He usually keeps 1s. a week, and has his dinners
at home. There are four children, all under five.
The rent is 4s. 6d. for one room. They do not
insure, and are slightly in debt. Mrs. X. is a
good manager. This menu was taken from a
week when Mrs. X. had 22s. 6d. given her by her
husband:</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>—Breakfast: One loaf, 1 oz. butter,
½ oz. tea, a farthing’s-worth of tinned milk, a halfpennyworth
of sugar. Kippers extra for Mr. X.
Dinner: Hashed beef, batter pudding, greens, and
potatoes. Tea: Same as breakfast, but Mr. X. has
shrimps instead of kippers.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>—Breakfast: Same as Sunday. Mr. X.
has a little cold meat. Dinner: Sunday’s dinner
cold, with pickles, or warmed up with greens and
potatoes. Tea: One loaf, marmalade, and tea.
Mr. X. has two eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>—Breakfast: One loaf, 1 oz. butter,
two pennyworth of cocoa. Bloaters for Mr. X.
Dinner: Bread and dripping, with cheese and
tomatoes. Tea: One loaf, marmalade, and tea.
Fish and fried potatoes for Mr. X.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>—Breakfast: One loaf, 1 oz. butter,
tea. Corned beef for Mr. X. Dinner: Boiled
bacon, beans, and potatoes. Tea: One loaf,
1 oz. butter, and tea. Cold bacon for Mr. X.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>—Breakfast: One loaf, jam, and tea.
Dinner: Mutton chops, greens, and potatoes.
Tea: One loaf, 1 oz. butter, and tea.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>—Breakfast: One loaf, 1 oz. butter, and
tea. Dinner: Sausages and potatoes. Tea: One
loaf, jam, and tea.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>—Breakfast: One loaf, 1 oz. butter,
two pennyworth of cocoa. Dinner: Pudding of
“pieces,” greens, and potatoes. Tea: One loaf,
1 oz. butter, and tea. Fish and fried potatoes for
Mr. X.</p>

<p>These children look fairly well and seem vigorous.
The baby is being nursed. The other three
live chiefly on bread, with potatoes and greens
and a tiny portion of meat at dinner.</p>

<p>The budget of the whole expenses of this family
for a week, though not necessarily for the same
week as that of the menu, is given on p. 115.</p>

<p>It will be noticed in this menu that Mr. T.
gets no relish for either tea or breakfast throughout
the week, with the exception of his Sunday
treat. His 6d. dinner cannot be of a heavy
nature, and his share of the family breakfasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and teas would in no way make up for a scanty
dinner. He is not, therefore, too well fed. His
wife and six children, who manage upon the
dinners given in the menu, obviously do not get
sufficient nourishment. This woman is an excellent
cook, but her equipment is poor. She
keeps her two rooms as clean as a new pin, and is
punctual and methodical to a fault. But she is
worn and tired, and unable to take in new ideas.
The children are fairly well, but nervous and
restless. They are not up to the normal size for
their age, nor are they intelligent for their years.
They are docile and give no trouble at school,
and are considered “well brought up” by all
who come into contact with them.</p>

<p>The following menu is that of the woman
whose daily expenditure of 3s. a day is given in
a previous chapter. Her husband, it will be
remembered, pays rent and insurance, and brings
home from his dust-heaps a sufficiency of fuel
and soap. It is, unfortunately, not the menu of
the week of which the expenditure is given.
Mr. Z. allows his wife 3s. a day. There are four
children under six. The rent of the one room is
5s. 6d.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>—Breakfast: Half a loaf of bread,
butter, and tea. Dinner: Roast mutton, potatoes,
and greens (5d.). Tea: Half a loaf of bread,
butter, and tea; 2d. cake for him.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>—Breakfast: Half a loaf of bread,
rolled oats with tinned milk. Dinner: Cold meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
cooked up with onions, carrots, greens, and
potatoes. Tea: Half a loaf of bread, jam, and
tea.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>—Breakfast: Half a loaf of bread, jam,
and tea. Dinner: Mutton chops, potatoes, and
greens. Tea: Half a loaf of bread, butter, and
tea; fish for him.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>—Breakfast: Half a loaf of bread,
butter, and cocoa. Dinner: Stew 1 lb. pieces
(4½d.), with rice, carrots, onions, and potatoes.
Tea: Half a loaf of bread, butter, and tea; fish
for him.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>—Breakfast: Half a loaf of bread,
tea, rolled oats and tinned milk. Dinner: Boiled
neck, with potatoes, onions, rice, and greens.
Tea: Half a loaf of bread, butter, and tea; fish
for him.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>—Breakfast: Half a loaf of bread,
butter, and tea. Dinner: Suet pudding and
treacle. Tea: Half a loaf of bread, jam, and tea.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>—Breakfast: Half a loaf of bread,
butter, and tea. Dinner: Eggs (5d.) and bacon
(3d.). Tea: Half a loaf of bread, butter, and tea.</p>

<p>It has already been admitted that Mrs. Z. is not
such a good manager as most of the women dealt
with in this investigation. She had two special
difficulties to struggle with. Her husband’s trade
caused him to return home with clothes and
skin almost equally black. He had no chance
of a bath in the one room, and her instincts in
the direction of cleanliness—whatever they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
once have been—had evidently wilted in an
unsympathetic atmosphere. Moreover, his hours
were very irregular, and he was often a great deal
at home in the afternoon. The daily payments
were another stumbling-block, and there was no
absolute certainty that the sum received would
be 3s. Occasionally it was 2s., and sometimes
it was only 1s. 6d. On one never-to-be-forgotten
occasion when the visitor was present it was
nothing at all, owing to his having arrived at
work too late. These two influences certainly
caused Mrs. Z. to be somewhat of a sloven; as
she said: “It was rather funny gettin’ accustomed
ter sleepin’ with ’im—all black like that.” And
all the time Mr. Z. is a most excellent husband,
with a great admiration for his nice-looking wife.
Mr. Z. never seemed to ail. He was a small man,
and very muscular for his height. Mrs. Z.,
though anæmic, was a well-made, upright young
woman, who was rather proud of her pretty
figure. The four children were big and fat and
fairly intelligent. They seemed thoroughly satisfactory
until the eldest boy started “wastin’”—a
process Lambeth children are given to embarking
upon. He “wasted” and grew visibly
thinner, to the complete bewilderment, according
to Mrs. Z., of the “mission” doctor and the
hospital doctor, to whom she took him. Both
parents were overcome with alarm and sorrow,
and the day that Ernie turned and took his food
again was a day of great rejoicing. He never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
seemed to be so strong again, however, and the
obstinate continuance of a bad form of eczema
upon all the other three children, in spite of
every kind of treatment by doctor and district
nurse, points to a worse state of health than
seemed at first to obtain amongst them. Mrs. Z.
was a very affectionate mother, and prided herself
on the fact that her four children were “a sight
bigger for their age” than all the others in the
street.</p>

<p>The next menu is that of Mrs. O., whose
husband is a printer’s labourer. He earns 30s.
a week, and at Christmas he works overtime,
which enables him, by working very long hours,
to earn an irregular amount of extra money.
Out of this he buys the children, of whom there
are eight, their boots for the year, and some part
of their clothing.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>—Breakfast: Fish all round, loaf of
bread, margarine, 2 teaspoonfuls of tea, 4½ teaspoonfuls
of tinned milk, small spoonful of sugar
each. Dinner: 3½ lbs. meat (1s. 9d.), greens, and
potatoes; very occasionally a suet pudding. Tea:
Tea, bread, margarine, and watercress (½d.).</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>—Breakfast: Tea, bread, and margarine;
rasher for him. Dinner: Cold meat and
vegetables left from Sunday. Tea is bread and
margarine every day in the week.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>—Breakfast: Tea, bread, and margarine;
haddock for him. Dinner: Baked breast
of mutton (7½d.), greens, and potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>—Breakfast: Tea, bread, and margarine;
rasher for him. Dinner: Stew of “pieces,”
pot herbs, and potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>—Breakfast: Tea, bread, and margarine;
fish for him (2d.). Dinner: 1 lb. sausages
(5d.) and potatoes; ½ lb. “skirt” of beef for him.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>—Breakfast: Tea, bread, and margarine;
rasher for him (2d.). Dinner: Fried strips of
breast of mutton (4½d.) and potatoes; two chops
for him (5d.).</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>—Breakfast: Tea, bread, and margarine;
fish for him (2d.). Dinner: 1 lb. pork
chops (9½d.), four to a pound; he has one. Other
three divided among seven children, with potatoes.
She has an egg later. Supper: 6 ozs. cold meat
from cookshop, with a lettuce for him. If any
over she has some.</p>

<p>The mother here is a tall, well-made woman,
and the father, who has been a soldier and went
all through the South African War, is also of
decent proportions. The children, however, are
stunted, particularly the younger ones. They
are sharp and intelligent, and very well behaved.
They are not often ill, except for the usual visitations
of measles and whooping-cough, but their
eyes need close attention, which their mother
religiously and painstakingly gives them daily.
Two of them have been operated on for adenoids,
and the third youngest, who is three, is no larger
than a baby of one year, owing to a feeble and
ailing babyhood. Both parents are specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
attached to this child, who gave the mother bad
nights for two years, and has needed incessant
care and attention ever since her birth. The
two boy babies, of two years and six months
respectively, both terribly undersized, are far
less noticed and petted than this delicate little
girl of three whose life has always hung on a
thread.</p>

<p>An interesting menu and budget is that of the
Q.’s. He is a feather-cleaner’s assistant, and his
wages are 25s., out of which he allows 20s. to his
wife, and keeps 5s. for himself. There are two
children. They pay 6s. for the rent of two
rooms. Mrs. Q. is a hard-working woman, a good
manager, and extremely intelligent. The chief
interest in this menu is that Mrs. Q. shows the
way in which the little income is divided. Besides
keeping 5s. a week for his own clothing and
pocket-money, Mr. Q. has 6½d. a day allowed him
by his wife for his dinners on six days a week
when he is at work. Moreover, he demands 1s. 1d.
to be spent weekly on himself alone for relishes
at breakfast or tea. The income works out as
given on p. 123.</p>

<p>The menu runs thus: Throughout the week
every breakfast for mother and children consists
of their shares in half a loaf of bread, with a touch
from the weekly six pennyworth of margarine.
This is accompanied by tea made from the 4 ozs.
which has to last for seven days. The 2d. tin of
milk and the 2 lbs. of sugar, which also have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
do seven days’ duty, furnish the tea with milk
and sugar. The husband’s relish at breakfast
usually takes the shape of an egg.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>—Dinner is roast mutton, greens, and
potatoes. Tea is tea, made as above, and toast.
All the week-day teas for mother and children
are a repetition of breakfast. Mr. Q. has fish or
a rasher added.</p>

<p>The week-day dinners run thus:</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>—Cold mutton left from Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>—Cold mutton left from Monday.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>—Stew of ½ lb. “pieces” (2¼d.) and
potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>—Meat pudding from other ½ lb. of
“pieces” (2¼d.) and potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>—Liver (3d.), one rasher (1½d.), and
potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>—Two herrings (3d.).</p>

<p>The sad part of these menus is that, though on
paper it looks very selfish of Mr. Q., in practice
his share of the half-loaf, even though accompanied
by an egg, does not seem a very satisfactory
or over-luxurious breakfast for a working
man. His daily dinner at 6½d. cannot be an
oppressive meal, whilst his tea cannot be much
more satisfying than his breakfast. And yet, in
order to feed him as well as this, his wife has to
make about a third of the amount do for herself.
It is not usual to find the accounts kept in this
manner, but Mrs. Q. chose to show how the money
went. As a matter of fact, except for the 5s.
which Mr. Q. keeps for himself—a sum greater
than that which is usually retained by the husband—the
arrangements of the menu are quite
ordinary.</p>

<p>The next menu is that of Mrs. U., whose
husband drives a mail-van at night. His wages
are 25s. a week, and he allows his wife 21s.
Out of the 4s. kept by him, the usual 4d. goes in
National Health Insurance, 6d. in a sick club,
1d. to the hospital, 1d. to the mess-room, and 6d.
to his trade union. He is fed entirely at home.
Mrs. U. has a daughter of fourteen, who goes out
to daily work and is fed at home. She earns 4s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a week, and brings it home regularly to her
mother. Thus the housekeeping allowance is
25s. a week. Mrs. U. bakes at home in the gas-oven,
at the cost in gas of about 6d. a week, and
for flour and yeast of 4s. 7d. The item for bread
is therefore high, but so also is the quality of
the bread. There are six children.</p>

<p>Most breakfasts and teas in the week consist
of bread, margarine, tea, cocoa, or coffee, or
occasionally of porridge and treacle.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>—Dinner: Target of mutton (10d.),
potatoes, greens, suet pudding, and haricot beans.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>—Dinner: Boiled neck (4d.), potatoes,
and dumplings.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>—Dinner: Stew of “pieces” (4d.)
with pot herbs and potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>—Dinner: Brown hash (4d.) and
dumplings.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>—Dinner: Meat pudding of shin of
beef (4d.), greens, and potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>—Dinner: Fish (1 lb., 4d.), parsley
sauce, and potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>—Dinner: Liver (4d.), bacon (2d.),
greens, and potatoes.</p>

<p>A week’s budget of Mrs. U. is given on p. 126.</p>

<p>Mrs. U. is an excellent manager, and certainly
tries to feed her family well. But her plans are
sadly interfered with when one of the children
needs new boots, and, with six children, one or
other of them is always needing something new.
There are two courses which are taken according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to the merits of the case. One is to pawn the
mother’s boots, thus rendering her a prisoner in
the two tiny rooms until the money to release her
belongings can be raised, and the other is to save
the amount out of food. She makes all the clothes
that can be made at home, and is an expert
needlewoman. She was a professed cook earning
£1 a week before she married. No burial insurance
is paid in this family.</p>

<p>We now come to the week’s menu of a couple
of families where the man was temporarily out
of work, and took anything he could get. Mr. T.
was carman for a large firm that employed all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
enormous number of carmen by the day. The
inner ring of men were given a day’s work every
day, and earned 3s. 6d., which they were paid on
leaving work each night. The less fortunate
outer ring were given a couple or three days’ work
in the week. No notice was taken or given on
either side. A day’s work might mean at Christmas
time a day of twenty hours, and no meal-time
allowed. It might mean a much shorter day,
but usually ran about twelve hours. Mr. T.
had two days’ work a week, but he washed down
another man’s van every day for 1s. 6d. a week.
Occasionally he was lucky enough to have two
vans to wash, when his money would amount to
10s. He allowed his wife 8s. 6d. There was one
child. The rent for the single room was 3s. 6d.,
and there was no insurance.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>—Breakfast: Bloater for father, 1 teaspoonful
of tea between them, 1 teaspoonful of
milk from tin each, 1 small spoonful of sugar each,
two slices of bread and margarine. Dinner: Six
pennyworth of neck of mutton, greens and potatoes
given by mother. Tea: Two slices of bread,
margarine, and tea.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>—Breakfast: Two slices of bread and
butter, with tea, for every breakfast in the week.
Dinner: Cold meat and vegetables left from
Sunday. Tea: Two slices of bread and butter,
with tea, for every tea in the week.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>—Dinner: Fresh herring each, bread
and butter (one slice).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>—Dinner: ½ lb. “pieces” (3d.)
stewed with potatoes, which were given by mother.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>—Dinner: What is left of stew and
potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>—Dinner: ½ lb. rashers (3d.), with
potatoes given by mother.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>—Dinner: The other ½ lb. rashers,
with potatoes given by mother.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that no coal appears. The
time of year was summer, and the fire was never
lighted during the thirteen weeks of their life on
8s. 6d. a week. The five pennyworth of gas was used
entirely for cooking, and light was supplied by the
farthing candle. The newspaper was their Sunday
treat, and was read solemnly through from first
column to last by both young people. It chronicled
more murders and multiple births than any paper
the visitor had ever seen. Mrs. T. would say in
course of polite conversation: “Have you seen the
news—five at a birth?” Then she would produce
a picture of three nurses and two doctors, each
holding a baby, and would murmur regretfully:
“They’re most of ’em dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The next case is that of a Mrs. X., a deserted
wife, with three children under eight. Mrs. X.
had “taken the law of” Mr. X., and there was
“an order out against him” for 7s. a week.
But as she was never able to make him pay it or
any part of it, she had to exist with the three
children on her earnings as an office cleaner in a
large bank in the city, where she was paid 12s.
a week. Unfortunately the bank was very far
from her home, and she spent 2s. a week on fares,
which sounds very extravagant, but it must be
remembered that she went to her work twice a
day. Her hours were six to nine in the mornings,
and six in the evenings until finished. She rented
a small room for 2s. 6d. a week until the sanitary
authorities found her out, and obliged her to move
into two smaller rooms at a rent of 4s. 6d. Owing
to her lack of beds and bedding she and her three
children were forced to sleep all in one bed in one
of the two smaller rooms exactly as they did when
she had but the one larger room. To mind the baby
of two while she was at work morning and evening
she paid a neighbour 1s. a week. Added to her
regular wage of 12s. as office cleaner, she occasionally
had a job on Saturdays, which brought her
in 1s. more, so that her income sometimes
amounted to 13s. a week.</p>

<p>Her menu ran as follows:</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>—Breakfast: Half a loaf, margarine,
and tea. Dinner: Sausages, 1 lb. (4d.), or
“pieces” (4d.), potatoes, sometimes pot herbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
sometimes greens. Tea: Half a loaf, margarine,
and tea.</p>

<p>Every breakfast and every tea in the week is
half a loaf, dripping or margarine, and tea.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>—Dinner: Remains of sausages and
potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>—Dinner: Flour pancakes, with sugar.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>—Dinner: ¼ lb. bacon, half a loaf of
bread.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>—Dinner: halfpennyworth of fish for
Lulu, and halfpennyworth of potatoes. Landlord
downstairs gave Mrs. X. some meat pie and
potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>—Dinner: Bread, margarine, and tea.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>—Dinner: Bread and three bloaters.</p>

<p>The eldest boy of seven has dinners at school
five days in the week in term-time. The girl is
three and a half, and is fed at home. The baby
is two years old. All the children are extremely
delicate. Since this menu was taken Mrs. X.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
has been lucky enough to get help from some kind
people. They have seen her elder boy through
an attack of rheumatic fever, and have clothed
the three children in warm and decent garments.
Without such timely help she would in all probability
have lost her boy.</p>

<p>There are those who, if they happen to read
these weekly menus, will criticise with deep
feeling the selection of the materials from which
they are composed. It is not necessary to pretend
that they are the absolute best that could be done,
even upon that money. It is quite likely that
someone who had strength, wisdom, and vitality,
who did not live that life in those tiny, crowded
rooms, in that lack of light and air, who was not
bowed down with worry, but was herself economically
independent of the man who earned the
money, could lay out his few shillings with a better
eye to scientific food value. It is quite as likely,
however, that the man who earned the money
would entirely refuse the scientific food, and
demand his old tasty kippers and meat. It is he
who has to be satisfied in the long-run, and if he
desires pickles, pickles there will be. The fact
that there is not enough money to buy good,
healthy house-room means that appetites are
jaded, and that food which would be nutritious
and valuable, and would be greedily eaten by
people who lived in the open air, seems tasteless
and sickly to those who have slept four in a bed
in a room 10 feet by 12 feet.</p>

<span class="smaller">AMOUNT SPENT A HEAD ON FOOD—PER WEEK,
PER DAY</span></h2>

<p>The remarkable thing about these budgets is the
small amount left for food after all other necessaries
have been paid for. When it comes to a
pinch, food is the elastic item. Rent is occasionally
not paid at all during a crisis, but the knowledge
that it is mounting up, and that eventually
it must be paid keeps these steady folk from that
expedient save at the very last resource. A little
less food all round, though a disagreeable experience,
leaves no bill in shillings and pence to
be paid afterwards. Down to a certain low
minimum, therefore, food may sink before leaving
the rent unpaid, or before pawning begins. That
low minimum differs in different families. It is a
question of the standard to which each has been
accustomed, but that it is possible to be accustomed
to an extraordinarily low standard these
budgets amply prove.</p>

<p>The following are a number of weekly budgets
taken at random:</p>

<p>Mr. A., whose house was visited from January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
1911, to February, 1912, was a railway-carriage
washer, and was paid 18s. for a six days’ week,
alternately with 21s. for a seven days’ week.
His wife was a good manager, but was in delicate
health. He was an extraordinarily good husband,
and brought home to her his entire wage. There
were three children born, and three alive.</p>

<p>Mr. E., whose house was visited from June,
1910, to October, 1912, was a painter’s labourer,
who never would tell his wife what he made. She
had 22s. a week in summer-time, and what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>

when in work. The eldest girl had just got into
a soda-water factory, and was allowing 4s. a week.
Owing to a period of almost entire unemployment
in the previous winter £3 4s. was still owing for
rent when the visits began. There were seven
children alive, three dead. One son had left
home.</p>

<p>Average per head for food all round the family,
1s. 3¾d. a week, or 2¼d. a day. Putting the father’s
3s. 6d. on one side, the mother and children average
1s. 1¾d. a week, or nearly 2d. a day.</p>

<p>To take now groups of men in the same trade
without giving the budget of each in detail will
give a more general idea. Eight carmen form
the first group. Their wages are extraordinarily
dissimilar. They, at the time their budgets passed
into the hands of the investigation, were working
for private firms, for L.C.C. contractors, and Post-Office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
contractors on every kind of terms. Paid
by the day or by the week, they were on night
work or day work, driving one horse or two, continuously
at work, or with long stretches of
waiting in a yard with no shelter. One Postal
van driver, who was a night worker, drove all
Derby Day in between two of his nights, and got
1s. 6d. overtime for it. The case of the carman in
a big West End private firm who got two days
a week has been already mentioned.</p>

<p>The cases are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Wage, 26s. Allowance, 23s. 6d. 6 children;
none dead.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Rent, 5s. 6d.—2 tiny rooms. Clothing as

1s. 6¾d. a week, or 2¾d. a day.</p>

<p>The week that 4s. had to be spent on new
boots these figures became for mother and
children 11¾d. a week, or 1¾d. a day.</p>

</div>

<p>2. Wage, 25s. Allowance, 21s.; girl’s wage,
4s.; total, 25s. 7 children alive, 1 dead,
1 away.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Two cases where the weekly wage was less than
18s., owing to the men taking temporary work in
unemployment:</p>

<p>7. Wage, 15s. Allowance, 12s. 6d. 2 children
alive, 2 dead.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Rent, 3s. 9d. (1 room). No regular clothing.
No burial insurance. Has since insured.</p>

<p>Average left for food—4s. 9d., or 1s. 2½d. per
head a week, 2d. a day: man could not have
his 3s. 6d. a week here, as that would leave
only 1s. 3d. a week between mother and
children. He probably manages on 2s.,
leaving 2s. 9d. for mother and two children.</p>

</div>

<p>8. Wage, 10s. Allowance, 8s. 6d. 1 child.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Rent, 3s. 6d. (1 room). No regular clothing.
No burial insurance. Has since insured.</p>

<p>Average left for food—3s. 10d., or 1s. 3⅓d. per
head a week, 2¼d. a day: here again the
man cannot take his 3s. 6d. a week, but
probably manages on about 2s., leaving
1s. 10d. a week for nursing mother.</p>

</div>

<p>The general average for the 8 women and
30 living children is 1s. 2⅗d. per head a week, or
2d. a day. Ten children have died, and 1
has left home, making the total of children
born 41.</p>

<p>Another group is 3 printers’ labourers, where
the average for 3 women and 18 living children
is 10¼d. a week, or 1½d. a day. Only 2 children
have died in this group, making the total 20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The average for the families of 2 horse-keepers
is 1s. 4d. per week, or 2¼d. a day. There are 9
children living, 2 have died.</p>

<p>Three plumbers’ and painters’ labourers form
another group, where 3 women and 15 living
children average 1s. 1½d. a week, or almost 2d. a
day. In this group 7 children have died, making
a total of 22.</p>

<p>In the families of 2 potters’ labourers, out of
10 children none have died. The 2 women and
10 children average 1s. 1½d. per week, or nearly
2d. a day.</p>

<p>Two theatre hands out of 14 children have lost
6, and the 2 women and 8 living children average
1s. 3½d. a week, or 2¼d. a day.</p>

<p>The average for all the women and children
within the investigation is 1s. 5½d. per head a
week, or 2½d. per head a day.</p>

<p>This average is worked out under the supposition
that the man has a uniform expenditure
on his food of 3s. 6d. a week, or 6d. a day, except
in about six cases, where the total amount left for
food was so small that it was obvious that the
man had to share more or less with the others, or
they could not have lived at all. An average of
six weeks was taken in each case, as the amount
spent on food varied very much from week to
week in some families. When clothes or sickness
made an inroad on the budget down went the
food.</p>

<p>Here is a case in point:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. M.: Wage, 25s. Allowed 23s. Three
children.</p>

12s. 2½d., or an average of nearly 1s. 9d. per head

almost 1s. 5½d., or 2½d. a day. The sum of 4s. 6d.

would be nearer the mark by the end of the week,
when the man has had his share of the Sunday
joint, and his share, with or without “relishes,”
of the teas and breakfasts. In no single instance
did the man seem to be having more than enough
or even enough. It was evident, however, that
in order to keep one person almost sufficiently
fed all the rest in nearly every case had to live
permanently on less than 3d. a day.</p>

<p>It must be remembered by those who are convinced
that the working man can live well and
easily on 3d. a day, because middle-class people
have tried the experiment and found it possible,
that the well-to-do man who may spend no more
than 1s. 9d. a week on food for a month or more has
not also all his other expenses cut down to their
very lowest limit. The well-to-do man sleeps in
a quiet, airy room, with sufficient and sanitary
bedding. He has every facility for luxurious
bathing and personal cleanliness. He has light
and hygienic clothing; he has warmth in the winter
and change of air in the summer. He can rest
when he is in; he has good cooking at his command,
with a sufficiency of storage, utensils, and
fuel. Above all he can always stop living on
3d. a day if it does not suit him, or if his family
get anxious. When his daughter needs a pair of
6s. 6d. boots he does not have to arrange an overdraft
with his banker in order to meet the crisis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
as the poor man does with his pawnbroker. He
does not feel that all his family, well or ill, warm
or cold, overworked or not, are also bound to live
on 3d. a day, and are only too thankful if it does
not drop to 2½d. or 2d., or even less, should under-employment
or no employment come his way.
It is impossible to compare the living on 3d. a
day of a person all of whose other requirements
are amply and sufficiently satisfied, with the
living of people whose every need is thwarted
and starved. Food is only half the problem.
Air, light, warmth, freedom from damp, sufficient
space—these, for adults—go to make up the other
half, and these for young children are even of
greater importance than sufficient diet.</p>

<p>In the households of well-to-do people two
kinds of diet can be used—one for adults, the
other for children. In the household which
spends 10s. or even less on food, only one kind
of diet is possible, and that is the man’s diet.
The children have what is left over. There must
be a Sunday joint, or, if that be not possible, at
least a Sunday dish of meat, in order to satisfy
the father’s desire for the kind of food he relishes,
and most naturally therefore intends to have.
With that will go potatoes and greens. The
children share the meat, if old enough, or have
potatoes and gravy. For those children too
young for cold meat there may be suet pudding;
but probably there is only bread and dripping,
and so on and so on, not only through the week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
but through the months and years. Nursery
food is unknown for the children of the poor, who
get only the remains of adult food.</p>

<p>It was reckoned by a young mother of the
writer’s acquaintance that the cost of <em>special</em>
food used for two children in her nursery was
10s. a week—mostly spent on milk, cream, and
fruit, items of diet hardly ever seen by children
of the poor.</p>

<p>That the diet of the poorer London children is
insufficient, unscientific, and utterly unsatisfactory
is horribly true. But that the real cause
of this state of things is the ignorance and indifference
of their mothers is untrue. What person or
body of people, however educated and expert,
could maintain a working man in physical efficiency
and rear healthy children on the amount
of money which is all these same mothers have to
deal with? It would be an impossible problem
if set to trained and expert people. How much
more an impossible problem when set to the
saddened, weakened, overburdened wives of
London labourers?</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE POOR AND MARRIAGE</span></h2>

<p>So many strictures are made on the improvident
marriages of the poor that it is necessary to look
at the matter from the point of view of the poor
themselves.</p>

<p>If the poor were not improvident, they would
hardly dare to live their lives at all. There is no
security for them. Any work which they do
may stop at a week’s notice. Much work may be,
and is, stopped with no notice of any kind. The
man is paid daily, and one evening he is paid as
usual, but told that he will not be needed again.
Such a system breeds improvidence; and if casual
labour and daily paid labour are necessary to
society, then society must excuse the faults which
are the obvious outcome of such a system.</p>

<p>In the case of marriage, as things now are, the
moment a man’s money approaches a figure
which seems to him a possible one he marries.
For the first year or even two years he may have
less ready money but more comfort. The wife
keeps their one room clean and pleasant, and
cooks, none too well perhaps, but possibly with
more attention to his special needs than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
former landlady did, or than his mother did, who
had her own husband as well as her other children
to cater for. The wage may be £1 a week. He
gives the wife 18s. and retains 2s. for himself.
The result of her management may closely
approach the following budget of two actual
young people who came within the investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. W., aged twenty, a toy-packer in City
warehouse—wages 20s.; allows 18s. He has
been married eighteen months, and when this
budget was drawn up a baby was expected any
day. His wages were raised from 18s. a year
ago. His wife before marriage was a machinist
on piece-work, and could earn 10s. a week. She
worked for six months after marriage, and paid
for most of the furniture in their one room; also
she provided the coming baby’s clothes. She is
clean and thrifty, writes a good hand, and keeps
excellent accounts. She is nineteen.</p>

<p>Out of the 2s. retained by the husband, he pays
6d. a week into a clothing club, and of course his
4d. is deducted for State Insurance. With the rest
“he does what he likes.” Sometimes he likes to
give the wife an extra penny for her housekeeping.
The menu, from the list of food purchases given
on next page, appears to consist of a sufficiency
of bread, of meat, of potatoes, and perhaps of
greens, as the husband’s dinners eaten away from
home probably include greens for him. Some
cold meat, with bread and butter and tea, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
be provided for the evening meal; bread, butter,
and tea would be the invariable breakfast.</p>

<p class="center">An average per head of 4s. 10¾d. a week for food.</p>

<p>If the wages never rise, and if the family grows
larger, the amounts spent on burial insurance,
soap, coal, gas, and, later on, rent will increase,
leaving less and less for food, with more people to
feed on the less amount. Extra bedding will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
eventually have to be bought, though the parents
will naturally put off that moment as long as
possible. Should the wage rise gradually to 24s.,
or even 25s., it would not all go upon the general
living. The man would naturally take a larger
amount of pocket-money, and out of the extra
sum which he might allow the wife, he would certainly
expect better living. A “relish to his tea,”
costing 2d. a day, mounts up to 1s. a week, and
a “rasher to his breakfast” costs the same. So
an increase of 2s. might be completely swallowed
up in extra food for the worker. And it would
be really needed by him, as his proportion of the
money spent would tend to diminish with more
mouths to fill.</p>

<p>Another instance of a young couple starting on
£1 a week is that of Mr. H., who is twenty-two,
and works in a brewery. Every third week he
has night work. He allows his wife his whole
wage. There is one child of six months. The
wife is twenty. She worked in a polish factory
until marriage, when she was dismissed, with a
small bonus, as the firm does not employ married
women. With the bonus she helped to furnish.
She is an excellent housewife, and keeps her room
comfortable.</p>

<p>Owing to Mr. H. getting home to his meals,
there is more elasticity in this menu. Much less
meat is eaten, and fish and bacon appear instead.
More bread, more tea, more vegetables are eaten,
and fruit is added. The usual breakfast is bread,
butter, and tea; the dinner a small amount of
meat, with potatoes and vegetables; the evening
meal, fish or bacon, with potatoes, as well as the
eternal bread, butter, and tea. All these four
young people are steady and intelligent. They
have enough to eat, but they are put to it for
proper clothing already. The H.’s will have to
move sooner than the W.’s if their family increases,
as their room, though a pleasant one, is not above
half the size of the other.</p>

<p>It is obvious that with both these young men
marriage is, so far, both pleasant and successful.
It is worth the sacrifice in pocket-money which
it must entail upon them. Their working life is
much the same as it was during their bachelorhood,
while their free time is more comfortable
and more interesting. Should they have waited
to marry until later in life, they would probably
have lived no cheaper as bachelors, though the
money would have been spent differently, and they
would have been less wholesomely comfortable.</p>

<p>The young women’s lives are far more changed.
They tell you that, though they are a bit lonely
at times, and miss the companionship of the
factory life and the money of their own to spend,
and are rather frightened at the swift approach
of motherhood, “You get accustomed to it,” and
“It won’t be so lonely when the baby comes,”
and “He’s very handy when he’s at home.” The
first baby is a source of great interest and pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to both parents, especially if it is well managed
and does not cry at night, though one young
father who was accustomed to a restless baby said
he “missed it ter’ble at night” when it was away
in hospital. It is different when the children
multiply and the room becomes crowded and food
is less plentiful. Then the case of the man is hard
and unattractive; the amount of self-sacrifice
demanded of him, if he be at all tender-hearted
towards his family, is outrageous. He must
never smoke, he must never take a glass of ale; he
must walk to and from his work in all weathers;
he must have no recreations but the continual
mending of his children’s boots; he must neither
read nor go to picture palaces nor take holidays,
if he is to do all that social reformers expect of
him when they theoretically parcel out his tiny
income. Needless to say, the poorly paid man
is not so immeasurably superior to the middle-class
man in the matter of self-denial and self-control
as he seems expected to be. He does smoke, he
does sometimes take a glass of ale; he does, in
fact, appropriate a proportion of the money he
earns to his own pleasure. It is not a large proportion
as a rule, but it upsets the nice calculations
which are based upon the supposition that
a man earning 25s. a week spends every penny
of it in the support of his family. He is, most
probably, a hard-working, steady, sober man; but
he may spend perhaps 2d. a day on beer, 1d. a
day on tobacco, and 2d. a day on tram fares, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that without being a monster of selfishness, or
wishing to deprive his children of their food. In
most budgets he keeps from 2s. to 2s. 6d. for himself,
in some 5s. or 6s., and in some nothing. He
varies as his brethren vary in other classes. Sometimes
he walks to and from work; sometimes he
pays his fares out of the money he keeps; and
sometimes he gets them paid out of the money
with which he supplies his wife.</p>

<p>Though fond of the children when they are
there, this life of stress and strain makes the
women dread nothing so much as the conviction
that there is to be still another baby with its
inevitable consequences—more crowding, more
illness, more worry, more work, and less food,
less strength, less time to manage with.</p>

<p>There are people who argue that marriage
should be put off by the poor until they have
saved up enough to secure their economic independence,
and that it would not hurt young men
on £1 a week to put off marriage till they are
thirty, they, meantime, saving hard during those
ten years. Should the poorly paid workman
overcome his young impulse to marry the moment
his wage reaches £1 a week, and should he remain
a bachelor until thirty, it is quite certain that he
would not marry at all. This may be a good
thing or a bad thing, but it would be so. A man
who for ten years had had the spending of 20s.
a week—and it is a sum which is soon spent without
providing luxuries—would not, at thirty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
when perhaps cold reason would direct his impulse,
feel inclined to share his £1 a week with an
uncertain number of other people. His present
bent is towards married life. It provides him for
the first year or two with attention to his comfort
and with privacy and freedom for his personality,
as well as satisfying his natural craving for sex-relationship.
Should he thwart that impulse, he,
being an average, normal man, will have to find
other ways of dealing with these desires of his.
He is not likely to starve every instinct for ten
years in order, perhaps, to save a sum which
might bring in an income of a couple of shillings
a week to add to his weekly wage. He would
know, by the time he was thirty, that even 22s. a
week does not guarantee a family against misery
and want. The self-sacrifice demanded of the
father of even a small family on such an income
would appal him.</p>

<p>The young couple who marry and live contentedly
on 20s. a week are usually members of
families of at least four or five persons, and have
struggled through their childhood on their share
of an income which may have been anything from
20s. to 25s. or 26s. a week. Their standard of
comfort is disastrously low, and they do not for
the first year or two realise that even two or three
children will develop into a burden which is too
great for their strength. It is not the greater
number of children alone: it is the greater cost of
accommodating, feeding, and clothing boys and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
girls as they get older which increases the strain.
Moreover, the separation of interests soon begins
to show itself. The husband goes to the same
work—hard, long, and monotonous—but at least
a change from the growing discomfort of the home.
He gets accustomed to seeing his wife slave, and
she gets accustomed to seeing him appear and disappear
on his daily round of work, which gradually
appeals less and less to her imagination, till,
at thirty, she hardly knows what his duties are—so
overwhelmed is she in the flood of her own
most absorbing duties and economies. Her
economies interfere with his comfort, and are
irksome to him; so he gets out of touch with her
point of view. He cannot see why the cooking
should be less satisfactory than it used to be, and
says so. She knows she needs a new saucepan,
but cannot possibly afford to buy one, and says
so. He makes his wife the same allowance, and
expects the same amount of food. She has more
mouths to fill, and grows impatient because he
does not understand that, though their first baby
did not seem to make much difference, a boy of
three, plus a baby, makes the old problem into
quite a new one.</p>

<p>One of her questions is the balance between
rent and food, which is of enormous importance.
Yet she never can feel certain that she has found
the right solution. Shall they all live in one
room? Or shall they take two basement rooms
at an equally low rent, but spend more on gas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and coal, and suffer more from damp and cold?
Or shall they take two rooms above stairs and take
the extra rent out of the food? Her own appetite
may not be very large, so she decides perhaps
on the two better rooms upstairs. She may
decide wisely, as we think, but the sacrifice in food
is not to be ignored in its results on the health of
the children.</p>

<p>Another of her problems is, How is she to keep
her husband, the bread-winner, in full efficiency
out of the few shillings she can spend on food, and
at the same time satisfy the appetites of the
children? She decides to feed him sufficiently
and to make what is over do for herself and the
children. This is not considered and thought-out
self-sacrifice on her part. It is the pressure of
circumstances. The wage-earner must be fed.
The arrangement made between husband and
wife in cases where the man’s work is at a distance—that
6d. a day, or 3s. a week, should be
allowed by her for his dinners—may have begun,
as in the case already quoted, before any children
had appeared, and may continue when there are
six children. Even if the wage has increased,
and if, instead of 20s., the worker is getting 23s.
or 24s., he probably keeps an extra shilling for
himself. Instead of allowing his wife 18s. a
week, he allows her 20s. or 21s. If she has
several children, the father’s weekly 3s. for dinner
is far harder to compass than when she managed
for two only on 18s. Rent, instead of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
from 3s. 6d. to 5s. for one “good” upstairs room,
amounts to from 6s. to 7s. for two upstairs
rooms, or, if house-room be sacrificed to food, rent
may be 5s. 6d. for two deadly basement rooms.
Insurance has mounted from 3d. a week to 9d. a
week. Gas which was 6d. is now 1s., on account
of the extra cooking. Soap and other cleaning
materials have increased in quantity, and therefore
in expense from 2d. to 5½d. Clothing is a
problem for which very few weekly figures are
available. It must be covered by payments to
clothing and boot clubs, or each article must be
bought when needed. In any case the expense
is greater and the amount of money available for
food grows less. The unvarying amount paid
for the bread-winner’s necessary daily food
becomes a greater proportion of the food bill, and
leaves all the increasing deficit to be met out of
the food of the mother and children. It is unavoidable
that it should be so; nobody wastes
time thinking about it; but the fact that it is so
forces the mother to take a different point of
view from that of the father. So each of them
gradually grows to understand the other less.</p>

<p>Both parents are probably devoted to the
children. The husband, who is sick of his wife’s
complaints, and can’t be bothered with her story
of how she has no boots to wear, listens with sympathy
and understanding to her tale of woe about
Tommy having no boots to his feet. The boy
who cannot speak at three years of age, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
girl who is deficient in weight, in height, and in
wits, often is the father’s special pet, for whom
he will sacrifice both food and sleep, while the
mother’s whole life is spent in a dreary effort to
do her best for them all round.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written, and much
more will be said and written, on the question of
the poor and large families. We wrangle as to
whether their numerous children are an improvidence
and an insult to the community, or whether,
on the contrary, the poorest class is the only class
which, in that respect, does its duty to the nation.
One thing is quite certain, and it is that it would
be as unthinkable as impossible to bring compulsion
to bear on the poor because they are poor.
For those who deplore large families in the case of
poor people, it must be a comfort to remember
a fact which experience shews us, that as poverty
decreases, and as the standard of comfort rises,
so does the size of the family diminish. Should
we be able to conquer the problem of poverty,
we should automatically solve the problem of the
excessively large family.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">MOTHERS’ DAYS</span></h2>

<p>In a previous chapter some description was given
of the way in which the women arrange their work.
It is the province of this chapter to describe in
greater detail the “days” of several of the
women—mounting up, as they do gradually from
the day of the young mother of one baby to that of
the worn woman of thirty-eight with eight children
under thirteen. Washing-day was not considered
fair by the mothers. They said, “You’d expeck
ter be a bit done-like washin’-day;” so an ordinary
day was chosen in every case. They
anxiously explained that the time-table form in
which the visitor took the day wasn’t fair either
because, “You jest as likely as not get a bit
be’ind if ’indered.” But the subject was so
richly interesting, and led up to such absorbing
anecdotes when left to the mothers’ taste in
method, that the time-table form had to be used
in self-protection by the visitor. The following
is a specimen of a mother’s way of telling it:</p>

<p>“Me young man ’as ter be up abart five. E’s a fair
whale at sleep. If I didn’t wake ’im ’e’d be late
all the days in the year: <em>I</em> tell yer. E’ come ’ome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
abart six, ’n soon’s ’e’s ’ad ’is tea ’e’s that sleepy
agen you’d ’ardly get a word off ’im.” Gently
reminded here that it is her own day that is
required, she continues: “Oh, me? Well, I tells
yer I wakes ’im at five. I ’as ter give ’im a good
thump, an’ ’e gets up quiet-like if ’e can; but ’e
generly can’t, an’ then the kids begin talkin’, an’
I ’as a fair job ter keep ’em in bed. See that one
with red ’air—’e’s a fair treat in the mornin’s,” etc.</p>

<p>The first day given is that of a young mother
aged twenty, with her first baby—a fat, round
morsel who may be called well cared for after
the initial disadvantage of living with its parents
in one small and dismal room has been recognised.
The young mother owns a large sewing-machine,
of which she is intolerably proud. As
Lambeth mothers’ days go, hers is a very easy
one.</p>

<p>6.0.—Get up and light fire.</p>

<p>6.15.—Wake husband, who has to be off by
seven; get his breakfast.</p>

<p>6.30.—Give him his breakfast, and while he
eats it, nurse baby.</p>

<p>7.0.—When he has gone, put baby down and
eat breakfast.</p>

<p>7.30.—Wash up; do a little washing every day
for baby; air bed; carry down dirty water; bring
fresh up from yard (second floor).</p>

<p>8.30.—Baby wakes; give her a bath and dress
her; nurse her; let her lie and kick while sweeping
room and blacking grate and scrubbing stairs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
make bed; carry baby out, and do shopping for
dinner.</p>

<p>11.0.—Come in and nurse baby; get dinner
ready.</p>

<p>12.15.—Husband comes in; give him dinner.
He leaves a few minutes to one o’clock.</p>

<p>1.0.—Wash up, and nurse baby; take her out for
a walk, if fine, for as long as can bear it. She
is heavy. Come in when time to nurse her again,
and sit down to sew. Make all her clothes and
most of own, and mend husband’s.</p>

<p>4.30.—Get tea ready and cook relish.</p>

<p>5.0.—Husband comes in; give him tea, and help
him clean himself in warm water; wash up and
carry down dirty water, and bring up clean water.</p>

<p>6.0.—Nurse baby and get her to bed; husband
not strong, and likes to go to bed early; sit and
sew till time to nurse baby at nine o’clock. Get
everything ready for morning.</p>

<p>9.30.—Go to bed.</p>

<p>One week in every three the husband works at
night, instead of the day. The wife finds this less
convenient for her, and is certain that it over-strains
him, as he cannot sleep properly in the
day, though she tries to be as quiet as ever she
can. But the baby is bound to disturb him, as
the room is very small. During this week, dinner
is whenever he gets up, and all the cleaning and
washing has to be squeezed in afterwards.</p>

<p>The next case is that of Mrs. O., who has but
two children alive, both very young. Two rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
have to be looked after, and extremely well looked
after, for Mr. O. is the gentleman who keeps 5s.
a week out of 25s., and expects 4s. 4d. a week
spent on his own extra food. He likes the place nice,
and cannot see that his wife need ever go out
except for the purpose of buying the family food.
He believes that women are prone to extravagance
in dress, and does not encourage Mrs. O. in any
such nonsense. When it was necessary that she
should come once a fortnight to the weighing
centre, to have the baby weighed, the price of a
pair of boots had to be saved out of several weeks’
food, much to the annoyance of Mr. O., who could
not understand why any of his family should ever
leave the two rooms where they live.</p>

<p>Her day runs as follows:</p>

<p>7.0.—Get up and get husband’s breakfast; nurse
baby while he has it.</p>

<p>7.30.—He goes to work. Get little girl dressed,
get her breakfast, and have it with her.</p>

<p>8.0.—Wash up.</p>

<p>8.30.—Get baby’s bath and wash and dress
him.</p>

<p>9.0.—Nurse him and put him to sleep.</p>

<p>9.30.—Do beds and sweep bedroom, and carry
up water (first floor).</p>

<p>11.0.—Start to make little girl a frock till baby
wakes; nurse him when he does.</p>

<p>12.15.—Get dinner for self and child ready
(husband has dinner away from home).</p>

<p>1.0.—Have dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>1.30.—Nurse baby and clear away and wash
up dinner things. Sweep and scrub floor and
passage, clean grate; every other week do stairs.</p>

<p>2.30.—Wash myself and little girl, and take
children out till four.</p>

<p>4.0.—Get tea and nurse baby.</p>

<p>4.30.—Clear away, and get husband’s tea; wait
for him till he comes in; very uncertain, between
five and seven o’clock; go on making frock till he
does.</p>

<p>6.0.—Put children to bed.</p>

<p>6.30.—Wash up husband’s tea things, if he has
finished. As soon as he has finished, he changes
and goes out.</p>

<p>8.0.—Go up The Walk for shopping for next
day, leaving children in bed.</p>

<p>9.0.—Mend husband’s clothes, and go on with
frock till ten.</p>

<p>10.0.—Nurse baby and make both children
comfortable for the night.</p>

<p>11.0.—If husband has come in, go to bed.</p>

<p>This is not a hard day as things go in Lambeth.
The noticeable thing about it is its loneliness.
Mrs. O. knows nothing of her neighbours, and,
until the visitor insisted on the children’s getting
out every afternoon, and agitated for the boots,
Mrs. O. never took them out. She did her shopping
at night in order that her old slippers might
not be seen. She sat indoors and mended and
made clothes in her neat room, while her pale
little girl amused herself as best she could and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the baby lay on the bed. The husband merely
ate and slept at home. He was a particularly
respectable and steady man, who kept his clothes
neat and his person scrupulously clean. His
wife ministered to him in every way she could,
but saw nothing of him. He took no interest in
the little daughter, but was proud of the boy,
and it was by means of the boy’s need of fresh air
that he was persuaded to allow his wife to save for
her boots. For her he did not consider them
necessary, as he was in favour of women staying
at home and minding the house.</p>

<p>The next day is that of a woman who lives in
one room in buildings, with her husband and four
children. She is rather self-assertive and talkative,
very clean, rougher in her manner of speaking
to her children than most of the mothers, but very
affectionate to both children and husband. Her
old mother, whom she partially feeds, is a great
deal with her, and helps in the household work.
Her day is rather an easy one for Lambeth. The
eldest child is eight years old, and the baby is a
few months. As the room is in “buildings,” she
has water on the same level, so has not to carry
it up or down stairs.</p>

<p>4.30.—Wake husband, who has to be at work
about five o’clock. He is carman for an L.C.C.
contractor. Get him off if possible without
waking the four children. He has a cup of tea
before going, but breakfasts away from home.
If baby wakes, nurse him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>7.0.—Nurse baby.</p>

<p>7.15.—Get up and light fire, wake children,
wash two eldest ones. Get breakfast for self and
children.</p>

<p>8.0.—Breakfast.</p>

<p>8.30.—Tidy two children for school and start
them off at 8.45.</p>

<p>9.0.—Clear away and wash up; wash and dress
boy of three; bathe and dress baby.</p>

<p>10.0.—Nurse baby and put him to bed.</p>

<p>10.30.—Turn down beds, clean grate, scrub floor.</p>

<p>11.30.—Make beds.</p>

<p>12.0.—Mother, who has done the marketing,
brings in the food; begin to cook dinner.</p>

<p>12.15.—Children all in, lay dinner, and, with
mother’s help, tidy children for it.</p>

<p>1.0.—Dinner, which mother serves while Mrs.
G. nurses baby who wakes about then.</p>

<p>1.30.—Tidy children for school again.</p>

<p>1.45.—Start them off and sit down with mother
to their own dinner; wash up, tidy room, clean
themselves.</p>

<p>3.0.—Go out, if it is not washing-day or
day for doing the stairs, with baby and boy of
three.</p>

<p>3.45.—Come in and get tea for children. Put
boy of three to sleep, nurse baby.</p>

<p>4.15.—Children come in.</p>

<p>4.30.—Give children tea.</p>

<p>5.0.—Wash up and tidy room. Tidy children
and self.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>6.0.—Take up boy of three and go out for a
“blow in the street” with all four children.</p>

<p>7.0.—Come in and put children to bed. Nurse
baby.</p>

<p>7.30.—Husband returns; get his supper.</p>

<p>8.0.—Sit down and have supper with him.</p>

<p>8.30.—Clear away and wash up. Sew while
husband goes to bed. “Talk wile ’e’s doin’ it.”</p>

<p>9.0.—Send mother off. Get everything ready
for the morning. Mend husband’s clothes as
soon as he gets them off.</p>

<p>10.0.—Nurse baby and go to bed.</p>

<p>We now come to the day of a mother of six
children, with two rooms to keep. Mrs. T., whose
menu has already been given, is the wife of a
builder’s handyman on 25s. a week. The two
rooms are upstairs in a small house, and, as there
is no water above the ground floor, Mrs. T. has a
good deal of carrying of heavy pails of water
both upstairs and down. She is gentle and big
and slow, never lifts her voice or gets angry, but
seems always tired and dragged. She is very
clean and orderly. Her husband is away all
day; but he dislikes the noise of a family meal,
and insists on having both breakfast and tea
cooked specially for himself, and eats alone.</p>

<p>6.0.—Nurses baby.</p>

<p>6.30.—Gets up, calls five children, puts kettle
on, washes “necks” and “backs” of all the
children, dresses the little ones, does hair of three
girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>7.30.—Gets husband’s breakfast, cooks bloater,
and makes tea.</p>

<p>8.0.—Gives him breakfast alone, nurses baby
while he has it, and cuts slices of bread and
dripping for children.</p>

<p>8.30.—He goes, gives children breakfast, sends
them off to school at 8.50, and has her own.</p>

<p>9.0.—Clears away and washes up breakfast
things.</p>

<p>9.30.—Carries down slops, and carries up water
from the yard; makes beds.</p>

<p>10.0.—Washes and dresses baby, nurses him,
and puts him to bed.</p>

<p>11.0.—Sweeps out bedroom, scrubs stairs and
passage.</p>

<p>12.0.—Goes out and buys food for the day.
Children home at 12.15.</p>

<p>12.30.—Cooks dinner; lays it.</p>

<p>1.0.—Gives children dinner and nurses baby.</p>

<p>1.45.—Washes hands and faces, and sees children
off to school.</p>

<p>2.0.—Washes up dinner things, scrubs out
kitchen, cleans grate, empties dirty water, and
fetches more clean from yard.</p>

<p>3.0.—Nurses baby.</p>

<p>3.30.—Cleans herself and begins to mend
clothes.</p>

<p>4.15.—Children all back.</p>

<p>4.30.—Gives them tea.</p>

<p>5.0.—Clears away and washes up, nurses the
baby, and mends clothes till 6.30.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>6.30.—Cooks husband’s tea.</p>

<p>7.0.—Gives husband tea alone.</p>

<p>7.30.—Puts younger children to bed.</p>

<p>8.0.—Tidies up, washes husband’s tea things,
sweeps kitchen, and mends clothes, nurses baby,
puts elder children to bed.</p>

<p>8.45.—Gets husband’s supper; mends clothes.</p>

<p>10.0.—Nurses baby, and makes him comfortable
for the night.</p>

<p>10.30.—Goes to bed.</p>

<p>The last “day” is that of the woman who has
eight children under thirteen. The fact that her
husband works at night enables the family to sleep
seven in one room—the mother and five children
by night and the husband by day; in the other
bedroom three older children sleep in a single
bed. This woman is tall and would be good-looking
if her figure were not much misshapen.
She has quantities of well-washed hair, and good
teeth; but her face is that of a woman of fifty.
She is thirty-eight. She can stand very little
advice or argument, and simply does not listen
when either are offered to her. She seems always
to be hearing a baby wake, or correcting a child
of two, or attending to the soiled face of the little
girl of three and a half, who is so much smaller
than her younger brother. She once went for a
fortnight’s change to the seaside. The visitor
asked her, when she came back, what she had most
enjoyed. She thought for a considerable time,
and then made the following statement: “I on’y<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
’ad two babies along of me, an’ wen I come in me
dinner was cooked for me.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt that if Mrs. B. were stronger
she would not need to nurse her baby quite so
often. He is small and hungry, and will soon
need to be weaned if his mother is to work as hard
as she does on ordinary days; with extra exertion
on washing-days, and extra noise and interruption
in holiday-time.</p>

<p>Mr. B., printer’s labourer; wage 30s.; allows

upstairs to tidy her room for husband to sleep
in; makes her bed for him, which has been
airing since seven o’clock. Turns out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>

<p>1.30.—Washes hands and faces of five children,
and sends them off to school.</p>

<p>1.45.—Nurses baby, and sits down till 2.30.</p>

<p>2.30.—Washes up and begins cleaning. Sweeps
kitchen, scullery, and passage, scrubs them, cleans
grate; three babies to mind all the time.</p>

<p>4.10.—Children all home again; gets their tea,

<p>4.30.—Clears away, and begins to cook husband’s
dinner.</p>

beds, turns out his, airs his room, and
makes his bed up for herself and three children
to sleep in at night. All water used in bedrooms
has to be carried upstairs, and when used, carried
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>7.30—Washes and puts to bed two babies.</p>

<p>8.0.—Nurses baby.</p>

<p>There is no room for the “day” of the mother
who bakes her own bread. Her husband, who
works for a Post-Office contractor, is on night-duty,
and spends most of the day at home. He
is an old soldier, as are an appreciable proportion
of these low-wage men. He helps his wife in the
housework and the cooking, and their home is one
of the most spotless the visitor has seen. When
his wife was sent to the seaside for two weeks, he
managed entirely for himself and the five children.
His “day” would have been very valuable could
the visitor have persuaded him to make it out for
those two weeks. He apologised to her for not
making the money go as far as “mother” did,
for buying loaves and not baking the bread, for
scrubbing without soap, which he had forgotten to
buy; but a detailed account of his day he could
not give. He was a guardsman when in the army,
and stands six feet in his socks. He weighs
eleven stone at thirty-six—a stone less than when
he was serving. Here are the accounts for his
two weeks, alongside a budget of his wife’s, with
which to compare (see p. 173). He sent them with
the following letter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span>,—</p>

<p>“Unfortunately I had Rachel at home on
the Friday as Mother went away on the Thursday.
I could not do on the money; I had as you
will see to borrow 5s. as well as putting the
whole of my money in the house. The last week
I managed better, but had to miss my club. I
should have sent the list down to you each week
but Mother forgot to ask me to do so.”</p>

</div>

<p>The reference to Rachel is that she lost her
situation just as his wife left home. He had her
food to get as well as the other children’s during
his fortnight. She is an excellent worker, and got
another place as soon as her mother came back.</p>

<p>The items “ink, pen, nibs, stationery, and
stamps” directly mother went away are rather
touching. The enormous consumption of margarine—3s.
6d. as against 1s. 6d.—is an instance of
the way in which the father is kept in ignorance of
the privations which are undergone by his family.
Directly he was left in charge, this father allowed
margarine all round on the same scale as he had
always used it himself, with the result of more
than doubling the amount spent on it. The item
in his first week of 2s. 3d. for gas when there was
no baking to be done, as against his wife’s 2s.
when there was, shows that the ½ cwt. of coal did
not suffice him, and that he cooked by gas. The
savings he made in his second week are most
entertaining. No soap or cleaning material of
any kind, no coal, no matches; and yet the grate
did not look bad nor the floor either when the
visitor saw them at the end of his strenuous time.
The amount spent on tobacco, his one luxury, is
interesting, as it is the sole instance in which
this item is accounted for in the budgets. He
was obliged to put every penny of his wage into
the general fund during those two weeks. The
penny for the hospital is a very common payment
in Lambeth—one which always comes out of the
man’s private purse. Incidentally, we are able
to construct his own private budget of 4s. pocket-money
out of this budget of his. It must run
something like this:</p>

<p>That the children of the poor suffer from insufficient
attention and care is not because the
mother is lazy and indifferent to her children’s
well-being. It is because she has but one pair of
hands and but one overburdened brain. She can
just get through her day if she does everything
she has to do inefficiently. Give her six children,
and between the bearing of them and the rearing
of them she has little extra vitality left for scientific
cooking, even if she could afford the necessary
time and appliances. In fact, one woman is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
not equal to the bearing and efficient, proper care
of six children. She can make one bed for four
of them; but if she had to make four beds; if she
even had to separate the boys from the girls, and
keep two rooms clean instead of one; if she had
to make proper clothing and keep those clothes
properly washed and ironed and mended; if she
had to give each child a daily bath, and had to
attend thoroughly to teeth, noses, ears, and eyes;
if she had to cook really nourishing food, with
adequate utensils and dishes, and had to wash
up these utensils and dishes after every meal—she
would need not only far more money, but far
more help. The children of the poor suffer from
want of room, want of light, want of air, want of
warmth, want of sufficient and proper food, and
want of clothes, because there is not enough to
pay for these necessaries. They also suffer from
want of cleanliness, want of attention to health,
want of peace and quiet, because the strength
of their mothers is not enough to provide these
necessary conditions.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CHILDREN</span></h2>

<p>In this investigation forty-two families have been
visited. Of these, eight, owing to various reasons,
were visited but for a short time. Three were
given up after several weeks, because the husbands
objected to the household accounts being
shown to the visitor; and here it would be interesting
to mention that in three other cases, not
reckoned in the investigation, the husbands refused
after the first week for the same reason as
soon as they thoroughly realised the scope of the
inquiry. In four cases the babies were born too
soon, and lived but a few hours. The investigation
was primarily on infantile mortality, so that
it automatically ceased with the child’s death.
One family moved out of London before the child’s
birth. There remain, therefore, thirty-four babies
who were watched and studied by the visitors for
many months. In every case but one these
children were normal, and thriving at birth. Only
one weighed less than 6 lbs.; four more weighed
less than 7 lbs.; fifteen more weighed less than
8 lbs.; ten more weighed less than 9 lbs.; and four
weighed over 9 lbs. The average weight at birth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
for the whole number was 7 lbs. 10 ozs. The
child which weighed 5 lbs. 12 ozs. at birth was
always sickly, and died of diarrhœa and sickness
during the hot August of 1911 at the age of six
months. Her mother was a delicate woman, and
had come through a time of dire stress when her
husband was out of work for four months before
this child was born. A baby born since, which
does not appear in this investigation, is now
about five months old. Not one of the others
seemed otherwise than sound and healthy, and
able to thrive on the nourishment which was
provided for their special benefit by the investigation.
One child, however, a beautiful boy of five
months, who weighed 7 lbs. 12 ozs. at birth, and
14 lbs. 14 ozs. at twenty weeks, died suddenly of
bronchitis in December, 1910. His mother’s
health record was bad. He was the sixth child
she had lost out of eleven. She was an extraordinarily
tidy, clean woman, and an excellent
manager; but her father had died of consumption,
and she was one of those mothers who economised
in rent in order to feed her flock more adequately.
She paid 5s. a week for very dark ground-floor
rooms. The death of the child was so sudden
and unexpected that an inquest was held. The
mother was horrified and bewildered at the entrance
of police officers into her home. She wrung
her hands and repeated over and over, “I done
all I could!” and never shook off the impression
that some disgrace attached to her. The burial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
insurance money paid by the company was £1.
Five shillings specially earned by the mother and
5s. lent by a friend brought up the amount to
the necessary 30s., and the humble funeral took
place. The child was buried in a common grave
with seven other coffins of all sizes.</p>

<p>With these two exceptions, the babies all lived
to be over a year. They usually did fairly well,
unless some infection from the elder children gave
them a bad cold, or measles, or whooping-cough,
when some of them had a hard struggle to live,
and their convalescence was much retarded by
the close air and overcrowding of their unhygienic
surroundings. Compared with babies who were
fighting such surroundings without special nourishment,
they did well, but compared with the children
of well-to-do people they did badly indeed!</p>

<p>The ex-baby, where such a person existed, was
nearly always undersized, delicate, and peevish.
Apart from such causes as insufficient and improper
food, crowded sleeping quarters, and
wretched clothing, this member of the family
specially suffered from want of fresh air. Too
young to go out alone, with no one to carry it
now the baby had come, it lived in the kitchen,
dragging at its mother’s skirts, much on its legs,
but never in the open air. One of the conveniences
most needed by poor mothers is a perambulator
which will hold, if possible, her two youngest
children. With such a vehicle, there would be
some sort of chance of open air and change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
scene so desperately necessary for the three house-bound
members of the family. As it is, the ex-baby
is often imprisoned in a high chair, where
it cannot fall into the fire, or pull over the water-can,
or shut its finger in the crack of the door,
or get at the food. But here it is deprived of
exercise and freedom of limb, and develops a
fretful, thwarted character, which renders it even
more open to disease than the rest of the family,
though they share with it all the other bad
conditions.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the healthy infant at
birth is less healthy at three months, less healthy
still at a year, and often by the time it is old
enough to go to school it has developed rickets
or lung trouble through entirely preventible
causes.</p>

<p>To take several families individually, and go
through their history, may serve as illustration
of the way in which children who begin well are
worn down by the conditions round them:</p>

<p>Mr. A., whose house was visited all the year of
1909, was originally a footman in one of the
houses of a large public school. He seemed at
the time of visiting to be fairly strong and wiry.
He was about 5 feet 8 inches in height, well
educated, and very steady. His wife had been
a lady’s-maid, who had saved a little money,
which she sank in a boarding-house kept by herself
and her sister. The boarding-house did not
pay, and when Mrs. A. married, the sister went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
back into the service of the lady with whom she
had been before. Mr. A. left his position as footman,
and became a bus conductor in one of the
old horse-bus companies. When visited in 1909
he had been fifteen years in his position, but
owing to the coming of motor traffic, his employers
gradually ran fewer buses, and his work became
more casual. He was paid 4s. a day, and got
four days’ work a week, with an occasional fifth
day. He had to present himself every morning,
and wait a certain time before he knew whether
he would be employed or not. All that he made
he brought home. His wife, who by the time
the visits began was worn and delicate, was a
well-educated woman, and an excellent manager.
She saved on all the 20s. weeks in order to have
a little extra for the 16s. weeks. Her sister in
service often came to the rescue when extra
trouble, such as illness or complete unemployment,
visited the household. There were five
children after the baby of the investigation
arrived. The eldest, a girl, was consumptive;
the next, a boy, was short in one leg, and wore
a surgical boot; the next, a girl, was the airless
ex-baby, and suffered with its eyes; and only the
new-born child, weighing 9 lbs., seemed to be
thriving and strong. The average per week for
food was 1s. a head for man, woman, and children.
Presently the conductor’s work stopped altogether.
No more horse-buses were run on that particular
route, and motor-buses did not come that way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Mr. A. was out of work. He used to bring in odd
sums of money earned in all sorts of ways between
tramping after a new job. The eldest girl was
put into a factory, where she earned 6s. a week;
the eldest boy got up early one morning, and
offered himself to a dairyman as a boy to leave
milk, and got the job, which meant work from
6 a.m. till 8 a.m., and two hours after school in the
evening. Several hours on Saturday and Sunday
completed the week’s work, for which he was
paid 2s. 6d. His parents were averse to his doing
this, but the boy persisted. The family moved
to basement rooms at a cheaper rent, and then
the gradual pulling down of the baby began.
The mother applied to the school authorities to
have the two boys given dinner, and after some
difficulty succeeded. The elder boy made no
complaint, but the short-legged one could not
eat the meals supplied. He said they were
greasy, and made him feel sick. He used to come
home and ask for a slice of the family bread and
dripping. The father’s earnings ranged between
5s. and 10s., which brought the family income
up to anything from 13s. 6d. to 18s. 6d. The
food allowance went often as low as 8d. a week.
A strain was put upon the health of each child,
which reduced its vitality, and gave free play to
disease tendencies. The eyes, which had been a
weak point in every child, grew worse all round.
The consumptive girl was constantly at home
through illness, the boy had heavy colds, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
younger children ailed. Work was at last found
by the father at a steady rate of 20s. a week.
He took the consumptive girl from her work, and
sent her into the country, where she remained in
the cottage of a grandparent earning nothing.
The boy was induced to give up his work, and the
family, when last seen, were living on a food
allowance of 1s. 6d. per head all round the family.
The baby was the usual feeble child of her age,
the children were no longer fed at school, and the
parents were congratulating themselves on their
wonderful good fortune.</p>

<p>Mr. B., whose home was visited part of 1911
and all 1912, was a printer’s labourer, and brought
his wife 28s. a week every week during the investigation.
He had been in the army, and
fought all through the South African War. He
seemed to be a strong man. His wife was one
of the few fairly tall women that were visited.
She had been strong, but was worn out and very
dreary. There were eight children, all undersized,
and increasingly so as they went down the
family. The ex-baby was a shrimp of a boy, only
eleven months old when the baby—another boy—was
born. The third youngest was a girl, and
was so delicate that neither parent had expected
to rear her. She weighed less than many a child
of a year old when she was two and a half. The
chief characteristics of these three youngest
children were restlessness, diminutiveness, and
a kind of elfin quickness. The baby, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a normal child weighing 7 lbs. at birth, caught
the inevitable measles and whooping-cough at
four months and six months, and at a year
weighed just 15 lbs. He could say words and
scramble about in an extremely active way—so
much so that his harassed mother had to tie him
into the high chair at an earlier age than most
children of his class. The eyes of all the children
in this family needed daily attention, and showed
great weakness. The eldest girl was supplied
with spectacles at school, for the payment of
which 2d. a week appeared for months in the
mother’s budgets. There was no specific disease.
The children were stunted by sheer force of circumstances,
not, so far as could be ascertained,
by heredity. The sleeping was extremely crowded,
and the food allowance averaged 1s. 2½d. a week,
or 2d. a day for the mother and children.</p>

<p>A third family is interesting for the reason that
the mother firmly believed in enough to eat, and,
being a particularly hard-working, clean woman,
she could not bear to take dark underground
rooms or to squeeze her family of seven children
into a couple of rooms. She solved her problem
by becoming a tenant of the Duchy of Cornwall
estate. She got four tiny rooms for 8s., and kept
them spotless. Her husband, who was a painter’s
labourer and a devoted gardener, kept the tiny
strip of yard gay with flowers, and kept the interior
of the damp, ill-contrived little house fresh
with “licks of paint” of motley colours and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
patches and odds and ends of a medley of papers.
When work was slack, Mrs. C. simply did not pay
the rent at all. As she said: “The Prince er
Wales, ’e don’t want our little bits of sticks, and
’e won’t sell us up if we keeps the place a credit
to ’im.” She seemed to be right, for they owed
a great deal of rent, and were never threatened
with ejection. She explained the principle on
which she worked as follows: “Me and my young
man we keeps the place nice, and wen ’e’s in work
we pays the rent. Wen ’e’s out er work in the
winter I gets twenty loaves and 2 lbs. er sixpenny
fer the children, and a snack er meat fer ’im, and
then I begins ter think about payin’ th’ agent out
er anythink I ’as left. I’d be tellin’ a lie if I said
I didn’t owe a bit in the rent-book, and now and
agen th’ agent gets a shillin’ er two extra fer back
money, but ’e carn’t ’elp seein’ ’ow creditable the
place is. That piece er blue paper looks a fair
treat through the winder, so ’e don’t make no
fuss.” The house they lived in, and many like
it, have been demolished, and a number of well-built
houses are appearing in their stead. The
Lambeth people declare that the rents have gone
up, however, and that the displaced tenants will
not be able to return, but this rumour has not
been inquired into. What happened to the C.’s
overdraft when they were obliged to turn out is
not known. The children of this family were
short and stumpy, but of solid build, and certainly
had more vigour and staying-power than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
those of the two other families already mentioned
in this chapter. The baby flourished. She
weighed 7 lbs. at birth, and at one year she
weighed 18 lbs. 10 ozs. She could drag herself
up by a chair, and say many words. The system
of feeding first and paying rent afterwards seemed
to be justified as far as the children were concerned.</p>

<p>Another woman who lived in “the Duchy,” as
they all call it, and whose house has since been
demolished, had not the temperament which had
the courage to owe. She paid her 8s. for rent
with clockwork regularity, and fed her husband
and four children and herself on a weekly average
of 8s. 6d. a week. The average for herself and the
children worked out at 1s. a week, or less than
2d. a day. All four children were very delicate.
The baby, who weighed 8½ lbs. at birth, weighed
16 lbs. 8 ozs. at one year. The ex-baby suffered
from consumption of the bowels, and was constantly
in and out of hospital. The two elder
children were tuberculous. The father was a
printer’s labourer, and appeared to be fairly
strong, though a small man. The mother was
delicate and worn, but seemed to have no specific
disease.</p>

<p>Some of the children in the different families
had strong individuality. Emma, aged ten,
stood about 4 feet 6 inches in her socks. Four
years later, when she began to earn by carrying
men’s dinners backwards and forwards to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
at work, she measured 4 feet 10 inches. At ten
she was a queer little figure, the eldest of six,
with a baby always in her arms out of school-hours.
She was not highly intelligent, but had
a soothing way with children. Her short neck
and large face gave the impression of something
dwarf-like. But she was sturdy and tough to all
appearance, and could scrub a floor or wring
out a tubful of clothes in a masterly way. She
had a dog-like devotion for a half deaf, half
blind little mother, who nevertheless managed
to keep two rooms, a husband, and six children
in a state of extraordinary order, considering all
things. When Emma’s school shoes were worn
out, her mother took them over and wore them
till there was no sole left, and Emma was provided
with a “new” fifth-hand pair, which were
generally twice too big. Emma’s mother found
her a great comfort, and very reluctantly sent
her to work in a factory at the age of fifteen.
There she earned 6s. a week, and became the
family bread-winner during the frequent illnesses
of her father.</p>

<p>Lulu was ex-baby to the deserted wife, and
was three years old when her mother was visited.
She was a lovely child with brilliant dark eyes and
an olive skin. She had round cheeks, which never
seemed to lose their contour, though their poor
little owner spent many weary weeks in hospital
after four different operations for a disease which
the visitor only knew by the name of “intersections,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
pronounced by Lulu’s mother with
awe and respect. Lulu would be playing, and
suddenly she would be seized with violent pain
and be hurried off in her mother’s arms to the
hospital. The visitor was present on one of
these occasions, when it seemed as though the
whole street knew exactly what to do. One
neighbour accompanied the mother and child,
one took over the baby, another arranged with
a nod and a word to take the mother’s place at
work that afternoon, and in two minutes everything
was settled. Lulu came out of hospital
four weeks later, with pale but still round cheeks
and a questioning look in her eyes which gave a
pathetic touch to the baby face. She still lives—the
very idol of her mother—to whom the two
boys are as nothing in comparison.</p>

<p>Dorothy, a person of two and another ex-baby,
was devoured with a desire to accompany her
elder brothers and sisters to school. She was a
fair, thin child, with bright blue-grey eyes and
straight, wispy tow-coloured hair. Her tiny
body was seething with restlessness and activity.
She spent her days in a high chair, from which
place she twice a day shrieked and wailed a
protest when the elder, happier ones started
for school. She was quick as a needle, and could
spend hours “writing pictures” on a piece of
paper with a hard, scratchy lead pencil. She had
no appetite, and had to be coaxed to eat by promises,
rarely fulfilled, of taking her for a walk as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
soon as mother’s work was done. She slept in
the chair during the day, as her mother declared
it was not safe to have her up stairs on the bed
or she would be out the window or down the
stairs directly she woke. She simply hated the
baby, another girl, which had condemned her to
second place and comparative neglect. At three,
she was kindly allowed a place in a school near
by, and her health visibly improved from that
moment. She became almost pretty.</p>

<p>’Erbie was of an inquiring turn, and during
fifteen months’ visiting had at different times
managed to mangle his thumb, fall into the mud
of the river at low tide, and get lost for ten hours,
and be returned by the police. He was excessively
sorry for himself, on each occasion, while
his diminutive mother took the catastrophies
with infinite calm. He was eight years old and
a “good scholar.” Physically he was a small
nondescript person, thin, and fair, and colourless,
with neat features and a shrill voice, which penetrated
into the core of the brain.</p>

<p>Joey had a tragedy attached to him, which
clouded a portion of his days. He was guilty of
telling a “boomer” to his parents. He said
that he had been moved out of the infant school
into the boys’ school when he hadn’t. One day
his mother accompanied him to the school gate
because it was raining, and she was protecting
him with the family umbrella. Then the horrid
truth was discovered, as the entrance for boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
is in a different street to that for infants. Joey
urgently declared that he had only been “kidding”
his parents, and that when they were so
wildly delighted and took his news so seriously
he had not had the courage to tell them it was
“kidding.” The net result was gloom and
disgrace, which floated round Joey’s miserable
head for many days. In the middle of this awful
time he <em>was</em> moved, and the strained atmosphere
was consequently relieved. He distinguished himself
in his new class, however, by his answer to a
question his teacher put to him as to the origin of
Christmas Day. “You get a bigger bit of meat
on yer plate than ever you seen before,” he
replied, and after a pause he added, “and w’en
’E dies you gets a bun.” The teacher had called
round to complain of this way of looking at
things, and Joey was in deep disgrace again. He
was a nice, chubby thing, with earnest ways and
some imagination. His “boomer” preyed on
him, and made him thin and anxious till the
climax was over. The second offence worried
him not at all. He was the pride and delight of
two very simple and devoted parents. His two
little sisters, both younger than himself, were
extremely attached to him.</p>

<p>Benny was twelve and very, very serious. He
was the boy who, without telling a soul of his plan,
offered himself to the milkman as a boy who would
leave milk on doorsteps. He earned 2s. 6d. a week
for the job, and faithfully performed the duties for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
some weeks, till a man who kept a vegetable shop
offered him the same money for hours which
suited him better, and he changed his trade.
He was a very small boy for his age, and had a
grave, thin face with inflamed eyes. An overcoat,
presented because the visitor could not
bear to think of his doing his round in the rain
and sitting all day at school afterwards in his
wet clothes gave him the keenest flash of pleasure
he had ever felt. He turned scarlet and
then went white. He had a resolute mouth and
a quiet voice and no constitution.</p>

<p>There is one little picture which must be described,
though the child and its mother were
unknown. The visitor in Lambeth Walk met a
thin, decent woman carrying a pot of mignonette.
By her side, a boy about seven years old was
hopping along with a crutch under one arm.
His other arm encircled a pot in which was a
lovely blooming fuchsia, whose flowers swung to
his movements. The woman was looking straight
ahead with grave, preoccupied eyes, not heeding
the child. His whole expression was one of such
glorified beatitude that the onlooker, arrested by
it, could only feel a pang of sharpest envy. They
went on their way with their flowers, and round
the next corner the visitor had to struggle through
a deeply interested crowd, who were watching a
man being taken to prison.</p>

<p>Questions are often asked as to how these
children amuse themselves. They are popularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
supposed to spend their time at picture palaces.
As far as close observation could discover, they
seemed to spend their play-time—the boys
shrilly shouting and running in the streets, and
the girls minding the baby and looking on. They
played a kind of hop-scotch marked out in chalk,
which reminded the visitor of a game much beloved
by her in extreme youth. Boys whose
parents were able to afford the luxury seemed to
spend hours on one roller skate, and seemed to do
positive marvels when the nature of the roadway
and the nature of the skate are considered. Girls
sometimes pooled their babies and did a little
skipping, shouting severe orders as they did so
to the unhappy infants. One party of soldiers,
whose uniform was a piece of white tape round
the arm and a piece of stick held over the shoulder
as a weapon, marched up and down a narrow
street for hours on the first day of the August
holidays, making such a noise of battle and
sudden death that the long-suffering mothers
inside the houses occasionally left their work to
scream to them to be quiet. The pathways
were full of hatless girls and babies, who looked
on with interest and envy. Needless to state,
no notice was taken of the mothers’ remonstrance.
The best game of all is an ambulance, but that
needs properties, which take some finding. A
box on wheels, primarily intended for a baby’s
perambulator, and with the baby inside, makes
a wonderful sort of toboggan along the paved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
path. The boy sits on one corner and holds
with both hands on to the edges, the baby occupies
the centre, and off they go, propelled by
vigorous kicks.</p>

<p>In holiday-time elder brothers or sisters sometimes
organise a party to Kennington Park or
one of the open spaces near by, and the grass
becomes a shrieking mass of children, from twelve
or thirteen years of age downwards. The weary
mother gives them bread and margarine in a
piece of newspaper, and there is always a fountain
from which they can drink. When they
come home in the evening, something more solid
is added to their usual tea. On Bank Holiday
these children are taken by their parents to the
nearest park. The father strolls off, the mother
and children sit on the grass. Nobody talks.
There is scolding and crying and laughing and
shouting, and there is dreary staring silence—never
conversation.</p>

<p>Indoors there are no amusements. There are
no books and no games, nor any place to play
the games should they exist. Wet holidays
mean quarrelling and mischief, and a distracted
mother. Every woman sighs when holidays
begin. Boys and girls who earn money probably
spend some of it on picture palaces; but the
dependent children of parents in steady work at
a low wage are not able to visit these fascinating
places—much as they would like to. Two instances
of “picktur show, 2d.” appeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
budgets. One was that of a young, newly
married couple. The visitor smilingly hoped
that they had enjoyed themselves. “’E treated
me,” said the young wife proudly. “Then why
does it come in your budget?” asked the visitor.
The girl stared. “Oh, I <em>paid</em>,” she explained;
“he let me take ’im.” The other case was that
of two middle-aged people, of about thirty,
where there were four children. A sister-in-law
minded the children, they took the baby with
them, and earnestly enjoyed the representation
of a motor-car touring through the stars, and of
the chase and capture of a murderer by a most
intelligent boy, “not bigger than Alfie.” Here
again the wife paid.</p>

<p>The outstanding fact about the children was
not their stupidity nor their lack of beauty—they
were neither stupid nor ugly—it was their
puny size and damaged health. On the whole,
the health of those who lived upstairs was less
bad than that of those who lived on the ground-floor,
and decidedly less bad than that of those
who lived in basements. Overcrowding in a
first-floor room did not seem as deadly as overcrowding
on the floor below. It is difficult to
separate causes. Whether the superior health
enjoyed by a first baby is due to more food, or to
less overcrowding, or to less exposure to infection,
is impossible to determine; perhaps it would
be safe to say that it is due to all three, but
whatever the exact causes are which produce in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
each case the sickly children so common in these
households, the all-embracing one is poverty.
The proportion of the infantile death-rate of
Hampstead to that of Hoxton—something like
18 to 140—proves this to be a fact. The 42
families already investigated in this inquiry
have had altogether 201 children, but 18 of
these were either born dead or died within a
few hours. Of the remaining 183 children of
all ages, ranging from a week up to sixteen or
seventeen years, 39 had died, or over one-fifth.
Out of the 144 survivors 5 were actually deficient,
while many were slow in intellect or
unduly excitable. Those among them who were
born during the investigation were, with one
exception, normal, cosy, healthy babies, with
good appetites, who slept and fed in the usual
way. They did not, however, in spite of special
efforts made on their behalf, fulfil their first
promise. At one year of age their environment
had put its mark upon them. Though superior
to babies of their class, who had not had special
nourishment and care, they were vastly inferior
to children of a better class who, though no finer
or healthier at birth, had enjoyed proper conditions,
and could therefore develop on sound
and hygienic lines.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF WORK</span></h2>

<p>There is a large class of people who get less than
18s. a week, because they get irregular work.
There is also a class of people who get a regular
wage which does not rise above 18s. They
get 14s., or 15s., and are generally supposed to
be doing a boy’s job. Men sometimes answer an
advertisement for a boy’s place and take it
rather then go unemployed altogether. The
firms who pay by the day often have men receiving
3s. or 3s. 6d. a day and doing three days
a week. In many ways it is possible for a man
to get less than 18s. a week. He need not be
a drunkard or a slacker. He may have been ill
and lost his regular job. His employer may
have sold the business. The works on which
he was employed may suddenly finish. He
finds himself out of work and, having no money
in hand, he is forced to take anything he can get
in order to keep his children from the workhouse.
It has been possible to follow the fortunes of a
certain number of cases who, for one or other of
these reasons, fell out of work. Their subsequent
struggles afford material with which to probe
the mystery of how such people manage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Q., a carter out of work through illness,
got an odd job once or twice in the week. His
wages had been 24s. Six children were born,
of whom five were alive.</p>

amounted to 15s. He found work in the north

known in Kennington, and rather than see them
go into the “house,” their friends would help
them through a bad spell.</p>

<p>Those children who were of school age in these
three families were fed once a day for five days
a week during term-time. None of the children
were earning. The three women were extremely
clean, and, as far as their wretched means would
allow, were good managers. It is impossible to
lay out to advantage money which comes in
spasmodically and belated, so that some urgent
need must be attended to with each penny as it
is earned. After a certain point of starvation
food must come first, though before that point
is reached it is extraordinary how often rent
seems to be made a first charge on wages.</p>

<p>Mr. V. worked for a relative who was in business
in a very small way. For driving a little
one-horse cart his usual wage was only 18s.,
and when the business fell off Mr. V. found himself
getting three days a week instead of six. Later
on he got half days and odd days, which only
produced a few shillings all told. He tried on off
days to get odd jobs of any sort. Four children
had been born, of whom two were living.</p>

<p>January 12, 1910, to January 19, he earned
8s. 2½d.</p>

<p>Friendly neighbours gave a little bread and
Mr. V. had some meals at a cabman’s shelter in
return for calling drivers when fares wanted them.</p>

<p>On January 27 he opened the cab-door for a
lady, who gave him 2d. The police were watching
him and he was arrested for begging. The
visitor was enabled to see the charge sheet and
speak in his favour. He was a week on remand,
and three days in prison. His wife borrowed
5s. from sympathetic neighbours.</p>

<p>Leaving for food 4s. 3d. This week Mrs. O.
was prematurely confined of twins. Both died,
and the case was automatically concluded.
When Mrs. O. recovered she found a place as
assistant “dresser” in a theatre. Her two boys
were taken care of by their grandmother, and the
household struggled back to something like its
previous income.</p>

<p>Mr. U., who lost his work because his employer
wound up the business, was a steady, well-educated
man. He was obliged to do odd jobs
between long tramps to find a fresh billet. There
were five children born, all living, but very delicate.
Mrs. U. had managed by dint of extraordinary
and penurious thrift to save £1 19s. 8¼d.
when the crash came.</p>

<p>July 6, 1910, money earned 23s. 7d.</p>

<p>Terror of using up the fund completely kept
Mrs. U. spending an average, all round the family,

the earnings increased again slowly, and the
fund mounted by pennies and sixpences to
£1 6s. 0d. Then the baby was a year old, and
the case came to an end. Mr. U. eventually got
work again at a very low but regular wage.
During this time of unemployment two of the
three children of school age were fed at school
for one term. The care committee of the school
to which the other child went did not consider
the case bad enough, and the two who did get
fed were only received after weeks of application.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
The mother’s very virtues told against
her. Her rooms were spotless, the decent furniture,
the tidy clothes of better days inclined the
school visitor to believe that food could be forthcoming
did the mother choose.</p>

<p>Mrs. X., a deserted wife with three children,
fell out of work owing to a dangerous illness
after the birth of her baby. When she recovered
sufficiently to work again, the parish relief,
which she had been receiving in kind during her
illness, stopped. She took in sewing and did
days’ washing and cleaned doorsteps.</p>

<p>In this instance we have 2s. 1½d. to divide
between three persons—an average of 8½d. a
week, or 1¼d. a day.</p>

<p>This woman eventually became an office
cleaner at 12s. a week, and her case is referred
to in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>However steady a man may be, however good
a worker, he is never exempt from the fear of
losing his job from ill-health or from other causes
which are out of his control. His difficulty in
getting into new work is often very great, because
new work in his own trade requires time
and patience to find. He may have to tramp
from one place of business to another day after
day, and week after week. His trouble is that
if he spends the whole of his time doing this no
money is coming in, and he and his must live. He
is therefore forced to take odd jobs which
bring in something, but which spoil his chances
of regular work. Numbers of men who have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
trade lose it, because they cannot afford the time
necessary to find a new job of the same kind as
the one they have lost. They are forced to take
anything that turns up in order to keep afloat
at all. So the friendly foreman who says, “You
turn up every morning at seven o’clock, and I’ll
call for you when I want a hand,” finds when he
does call several days later that the man is not
there. No amount of explaining next day that in
order to keep his family he did a day’s work
unloading a barge or sweeping snow is of avail
against the fact that another man has got the
job. Meantime, his clothes and his very muscles
are depreciating, and work in his own trade
becomes almost an impossibility to find. In
some employments, where it is a common custom
to give a man two, or three, or four days’ work
a week and pay him by the day, it is demanded
that he should turn up every day of the week
and wait for his work, or lose the few days he has
the chance of getting. The carters in certain
well-known West End firms are employed on
these terms. In many employments there are
a number of extra men who take duty when the
regular man has a holiday or fails to appear.
These extra men live a life of great poverty and
great uncertainty. The work they do may be
skilled, and they are bound to keep their hand
in, and bound to appear daily in order to secure
a few days a week for a wage which would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
barely sufficient did they get six full days. The
lives of the children of the poor are shortened,
and the bodies of the children of the poor are
stunted and starved on a low wage. And to the
insufficiency of a low wage is added the horror
that it is never secure.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STANDARD OF COMFORT</span></h2>

<p>In his book, “The Living Wage,” published in
1912, Mr. Philip Snowden devotes the third
chapter to an estimation of the number of adult
men, employed in the principal trades of the
United Kingdom, who are getting less than 25s.
a week. He quotes Professor Bowley, who in
1911 announced that 2,500,000 adult men were
getting less than 25s. a week when working full
time. This number, he explains, would be considerably
increased were the figures based on
actual earnings, as in almost every trade men
occasionally, or even habitually, work short weeks,
and get short pay during some part of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. Snowden, moreover, considers that Professor
Bowley had under-estimated the number
of adult men who, at full rates of pay, were earning
less than 25s. a week. He takes Board of Trade
returns, which show that in the cotton industry,
which is one of the best paid of our great trades,
40 per cent. of adult men earned less than 25s. a
week; that in the wool-combing industry the
average wage for adult men on full time was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
17s. 6d. a week; that in the linen industry 44 per
cent. of the adult men earned less than 20s. a
week, and 36 per cent. earned between 20s. and
30s.; that in the jute industry 49 per cent. of the
adult men earned less than 20s. a week, and 36 per
cent. earned between 20s. and 30s.; that in the
silk industry 19 per cent. of the adult men earned
less than 20s. a week, and 54 per cent. earned
between 20s. and 30s.; and he took also a summary
of the <em>actual</em> earnings of the adult men in the
textile trades of the United Kingdom, which shows
that for one week of September, 1906, 48 per cent.
earned less than 25s. a week.</p>

<p>For other occupations, Mr. Snowden, still
quoting Board of Trade figures, says that in the
clothing trade 7 per cent. of adult men earned
less than 20s. a week, and 27 per cent. between
20s. and 30s.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Of bricklayers’ labourers 55.9 per cent. earned
under 25s. a week.</p>

<p>Of masons’ labourers 67 per cent. earned under 25s.
a week.</p>

<p>Of plumbers’ labourers 54 per cent. earned under
25s. a week.</p>

<p>Of painters’ labourers 33 per cent. earned under 25s.
a week.</p>

<p>Of builders’ labourers 51 per cent. earned under 25s.
a week.</p>

</div>

<p>A still later return of the Board of Trade gives
information as to the wages of railway men in
1911. The figures show that 63 per cent. of the
adult men got less than 25s. a week. The earnings
of agricultural labourers, as given by the Board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of Trade, for 1907 were 15s. 2d. a week in cash, or
18s. 4d. a week, counting all allowances. Mr.
Snowden sums up the clearly set out facts given
in his chapter thus:</p>

<p>“The facts cited in this chapter show that on
the average something like one-half of the adult
men, most of whom have a family dependent
upon their earnings, do not earn 25s. 9d. a week,
and that of this half, a very considerable proportion
receive very much less than a pound a
week. When we have considered the cost of
living, it will be seen how wholly inadequate
these wages are, and how inevitable it is that the
consequences of this insufficiency should show
themselves in the physical and social conditions
of the wage-earning classes.”</p>

<p>In his estimate, Professor Bowley calculated
that about 8,000,000 adult men were employed
in regular occupations in the United Kingdom,
and that of these 32 per cent., or nearly one-third,
were earning, at full-time work, less than 25s.
a week. As we see, Mr. Snowden comes to a
different conclusion, and reckons that 50 per cent.
of the adult men in regular employment are
getting less than 25s. a week. If we take the
smaller of these two estimates and reckon that
one-fifth of the adult men are unmarried, we get
something like 2,000,000 families living on a
wage which is under 25s. a week. Again, to
quote from Mr. Snowden, “Sir Robert Giffen
estimated twenty years ago that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
2,000,000 families where the total income did
not exceed a pound a week.” Allowing that the
average family consists of a man and his wife
and two children, we get 8,000,000 persons who are
living more or less as are the people whose daily
life has been described in the previous chapters
of this book, while, if we take Mr. Snowden’s own
estimate, the number is far greater. That means
that the great bulk of this enormous mass of
people are under-fed, under-housed, and insufficiently
clothed. The children among them suffer
more than the adults. Their growth is stunted,
their mental powers are cramped, their health is
undermined.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago their fathers would have
regarded these children as economic assets, and
the family income would have been produced by
every member who was over a very tender age.
During the last century the State prohibited the
employment of children under a certain age—an
age which, as wisdom grows, tends to become
higher and higher. By this necessary action the
State formally invested itself with the ultimate
responsibility for the lives and welfare of its
children, and the guardianship thus exercised has
continually been enlarged in scope until it has
assumed supreme control of the nurture and
training of the youth of the nation. A birth now
means that a new human being must be fed,
clothed, and housed in a manner which the State
as guardian considers sufficient, for a period which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
we now hope to raise to sixteen years. If a man
in these days sets his young children to earn
money, or, if they be not fed, clothed, cared for,
and sent regularly to school, he can be put in
prison. If the children’s mother be a wage-earner,
she can also be sent to prison if her
children are not sufficiently cared for. Even the
non-earning mother who has only what her husband
chooses to give her can be imprisoned if
a magistrate decide that any child-neglect is
chargeable to her. It would seem reasonable
to expect that when the ultimate responsibility
for their welfare is undertaken by a rich and
powerful State, children should at least be in
receipt of sufficient food, shelter, warmth, and
clothing.</p>

<p>Instead, however, of co-operating with parents
and seeing to it that its wards are supplied with
such primary necessaries, this masculine State,
representing only male voters, and, until lately,
chiefly those of the richer classes, has been crude
and unwise in its relations with all parents guilty
of the crime of poverty. With the best intentions
it has piled upon them responsibilities which it
has left them to cope with unaided. We still
have the children of sober, industrious men and
women living lives which maim and stunt them
and make of them a handicap for the very State
of which they are part. And we have parents
whose wages are insufficient for their own needs
spending themselves to perform the impossible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and, while they fail, the State—their partner in
responsibility—looks the other way.</p>

<p>The first remedy for this state of things which
springs to the mind of the social reformer is a
legal minimum wage. The discussion of a minimum
wage, which is at the same time to be a
family wage, is exceedingly difficult. We realise
that wages are not now paid on a family basis.
If they were we should not have 2,500,000 adult
men receiving for full-time work a sum which
the writer has no hesitation in saying is less than
sufficient for the proper maintenance, and that on
the lowest scale, of one adult person. To pay
wages in future, on an adequate family basis, to
every adult worker who could possibly have
helpless children dependent upon him or her
would be a startlingly new departure. There are
none, in fact, who advocate it. And yet if we
are really attempting to solve the problem of
hungry children by minimum wage legislation, we
ought to aim at no less. Of course, what usually
is advocated is the paying of a family wage to all
adult men, while paying women an individual
wage—the assumption being that women never
maintain families. But we know this assumption
to be untrue. Many thousands of women do
maintain families, and if, through the medium of
the minimum wage, their children also are to be
kept in decency and comfort, the wages of women
must also be on the family basis. Another difficulty
in dealing with a family wage is the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of what sized family? There is no standard
either in numbers or in age. If the wage be calculated
upon a wife and two children, it will not
support a wife and six children. Nor if it be
calculated upon three children under four will it
support in equal efficiency three children of ten,
eleven and thirteen. Further, if a law which
would keep children at school until the age of
sixteen should happily come into force, the difficulty
of reckoning a minimum wage which would
suit everybody would be still greater.</p>

<p>A third difficulty is the fact that money paid
as wage for work done must, in the nature of
things, belong wholly and entirely to the person
who performs the work. He or she is free to
devote such money to any purpose they think
best, and cases are not unknown of children who
do not receive even such nurture as their parents’
means could allow. Many people solve these
knotty points by dropping women bread-winners
out of the problem, by arranging that the family
consists of five persons—a man, his wife, and
three children—and by assuming that every
parent thinks more of his or her children’s welfare
than of self. By doing this, they deal with
theories instead of facts.</p>

<p>The two sums that have been seriously discussed
by such various authorities as Mr. Rowntree,
Mr. Charles Booth, and the Labour party
are 25s. a week and 30s. a week. Neither sum
is really enough in some localities should there be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
more than three children, who are to be properly
housed as well as properly dressed and fed. And
neither sum as a hard and fast minimum, even
for men only, is considered practical politics by
anybody. Scientific minimum wage schemes
must consider and give weight to the conditions
of each trade and locality. Many decisions in the
worst paid trades will follow the example of the
decisions under the Trades Boards Act, and when
a minimum has been arrived at it will be—though
an advance on present wages—insufficient perhaps
to keep in real efficiency and comfort a single adult.</p>

<p>Moreover, to keep the children of the nation in
health and strength is too important and vital a
responsibility to be placed entirely on the shoulders
of one section of the community—namely, the
employers of labour. It is a responsibility which
should be undertaken by the only authority which
is always equal to its complete fulfilment—the
State.</p>

<p>Therefore, although any minimum wage scheme
which proposes to raise the bottom wages in any
trade or trades, or for any group or groups of
workers, is a necessary part of legislation, and
must be urgently insisted upon in any plan for
social reform, no minimum wage legislation now
proposed, or likely to be proposed, will deal adequately
with the question of all the children of
the working poor. Yet unless we do deal with all
of them, and deal adequately, the problem of the
nation’s children goes unsolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Two theories are sometimes seriously brought
forward as means by which the problem of hungry
children could be dealt with. One is that if only
the poor could be induced to cut down their
families to fit their incomes there would be no
problem. The other is, that if only the woman
with 20s. a week knew how to spend it she could
feed, lodge, and clothe her family with perfect
ease. The first of these two ideas—if it ever
possibly could be put into practice—would find a
cure for poverty by the dying out of all the poor
people. The man with 20s. and less could not
even marry; the man with 25s. might perhaps
marry, but could have no children; the man with
30s. might have one or two children—one is
tempted to say “and so on.” But the people
with incomes over the income-tax level do not
nowadays as a rule err on the side of too large
families. Many people with the comparatively
enormous sum of £10 a week hesitate to have
more than one or two children. It is obvious that
were the children of the poor limited according
to wage there would be no corresponding advance
in the size of the families of the rich. It is not
only that the nation would shrink, but the wage-earner
would automatically cease to reproduce
himself. It seems an heroic way of curing his
difficulties. Obviously as a palliative in individual
cases the plan of limiting the family according
to wage appeals with great force to the well-fed
and more fortunate observer, but as a national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
measure to deal with poverty it fails to convince.
That a man with 24s. a week is unwise to have
six children is perfectly true. But, then, what
sized family would he be wise to have? If he
were really prudent and careful of his future he
would, on such a wage, neither marry nor have
children at all. He could in that case live
economically on 20s. a week and save the 4s.
towards his old age. But we cannot expect
Professor Bowley’s 2,500,000 adult men to act
on those lines. The fact is they want to marry
and they want to have children. As either of
these courses is unwise on 24s. a week, they are
in for a life of imprudence anyhow. The very
facts of their poverty—close quarters and lack of
mental interest and amusement, and, above all,
lack of money—help to make the limitation of
their family almost an impossibility to them.</p>

<p>The other suggestion has been already dealt
with in previous chapters. It is always worth
while, of course, to teach an improvident and
stupid woman to be careful and clever—if you
can. But to put down all the miseries and crying
wants of the children of the poor to the ignorance
and improvidence of their mothers is merely to
salve an uneasy conscience by blaming someone
else. It is almost better to face the position and
say, “The poor should not be allowed to have
children,” than to pretend that they could house,
clothe, and feed them very well on the money at
their disposal if they chose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>In Schedule A in the First Report of the
Departmental Committee, with respect to the
Poor Law Orders, a diet for a child of over two
and under eight years is given, of which one day
in any workhouse might be as follows:</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>—Bread, 5 ounces; fresh milk, ½ pint.</p>

<p><i>Dinner.</i>—Roast beef, 1½ ounces; potatoes or
other vegetables, 4 ounces; fresh fruit-pudding,
6 ounces.</p>

<p><i>Supper.</i>—Seed-cake, 4 ounces; cocoa (half
milk), ½ pint.</p>

<p>No mother on 20s. a week could secure such
food for her children. It is not supposed that the
Departmental Committee appointed by the President
of the Local Government Board would prescribe
an extravagant diet, and it seems terrible
that the children of the hard-working honest poor
should be fed on a diet which is about half that
prescribed as the most economical and very least
that a healthy workhouse child should have. In
this report it has been decreed that the workhouse
child needs milk. Half of its evening and morning
meals are to be of bread and milk. Further,
“milk” is specially notified as meaning “new
milk, whole and undiluted.” If the workhouse
child needs about a pint of whole and undiluted
new milk a day, as well as other food such as
vegetables, fruit, bread, and cocoa, so does the
child outside the workhouse. No scheme of
porridge and lentils will do for a child without
milk, and milk is expensive. When the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
has fed the bread-winner in accordance with his
tastes and with some semblance of efficiency, she
has no chance of being able to afford even a half-ration
of milk for her children. When she has
balanced the problem of housing against that of
feeding, and has decided on the wisest course
open to her, she has still to put her children three
and four in a bed. She cannot separate the infectious
from the healthy, nor the boys from the
girls. She can never choose a sanitary and
healthful life. She can only choose the less of
two great evils.</p>

<p>No teacher of domestic science, however capable,
can instruct girls scientifically and in detail how
adequately to house, clothe, clean, warm, light,
insure, and feed a family of four or five persons
on 20s. a week in London. The excellent instruction
given by the L.C.C. teachers is based
on budgets of £3, 35s., or of 28s. for a family of
six persons. It was realised that to teach girls how
to manage inadequately would be false teaching.
If the scientific and trained teacher cannot solve
the problem, the untrained, overburdened mother
should not be criticised because she also fails.
The work which she is expected to do is of supreme
importance. It would be enlightened wisdom to
enable her to do it.</p>

<p>“They (women) are resolved, we may take it,

<p>What is needed is the true fulfilment of human
parenthood which is a natural unforced and unforceable
relation of the spirit as well as of the
flesh. Money, and the efficient, skilled service it
procures, can be provided from any source. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that close, personal affection and watchfulness
essential to children which no other guardianship
can replace can only be given by parents. Yet
even parents can be thwarted and embittered by
crushing toil and slavish drudgery until their
natural affection is destroyed. The nation needs
the active and free co-operation of fathers and
mothers in the upbringing of its children, and it
must enable them to do their share of the work.</p>

<p>At the present moment the nation, as super-guardian
of its children, acts, in the case of the
children of the poor, in a manner so baffling, so
harassing, so contradictory, that the only feelings
it induces in the minds of parents whose lives are
passed in incessant toil and incessant want are
exasperation, fear, and resentment.</p>

<p>Some painful cases show the way in which the
State, as guardian of its children, uses its great
power merely to punish the parent and not to
protect the child. Where either father or mother
is convicted and sentenced for cruelty, the child
is often left helpless in the hands of a still more
brutalised parent when he or she comes out of
gaol. Cases exist in which a father, sentenced to
hard labour for criminal assault on his own child,
can again be given custody of that child on his
return to work at the completion of his sentence.
Punishment of the parent may be a terrible
necessity; but the main object of reasoned public
action should be permanently to protect and
deliver the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>A wife may be granted in public court separation
from her husband for cruelty or desertion,
with an order that he should pay her a weekly
allowance for the support of the children of the
marriage. By spending on summonses money
she can ill afford, she may find it possible to get
her husband sent to prison for non-payment of
the allowance. But the court contents itself
with punishing the father, and takes no steps to
ensure the welfare of the children by enforcing
payment.</p>

<p>A mother, the bread-winner for three young
children, earned 12s. a week for work which took
her from home in the early morning and again
in the evening. During two daily absences, which
cost her 2s. weekly in fares, she was obliged to
leave her baby lying in its perambulator. The
illness of an elder child brought an education
officer to investigate his absence from school.
The officer discovered the boy in bed with rheumatic
fever, and the baby unattended. Meeting
the hurrying mother as she came back from her
morning’s work, he indignantly informed her that
it was against the law to leave a baby as hers had
been left. She must in future pay a neighbour
to care for it in her daily absences, or the police
would interfere. She pleaded with him; in her
ignorance of the ideals and methods of our English
law, she explained her circumstances. He was,
of course, sorry about it, but the upshot of their
conversation was that by the direct action of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Public Authority the mother was forced to pay
a neighbour to care for the baby, and the 10s. a
week on which four persons were living was further
diminished. Such a woman may be potentially
a good parent had she any means by which
she could make her good parenthood effective.
But her experience of State guardianship of her
children may be that Public Authority, without
troubling as to whether or not fulfilment be in
her power, forces further duties and responsibilities
on to her shoulders in respect of those
children—through the threatened medium of the
police, with all the horrors of prison in the background.</p>

<p>Suppose the State, as co-guardian of the child,
stripped off, when dealing with parents, the uniform
of a police-constable with a warrant in his
pocket. Suppose it approached them in some
such spirit as that displayed by the Public Trustee
when dealing with testators and executors. He
offers advice, security, a free hand in carrying out
any legal purpose, and he acts with or without
other executors, as the case may require. Why
should not the nation place all the information, all
the security, all the help at its command at the
service of its co-guardians, the fathers and
mothers? Why should it not act frankly with
them in the national interest, and help them to
see that the needs of the child are supplied?</p>

<p>The final responsibility for the child’s welfare,
the paramount authority in securing it, belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to the State. Why not recognise the national
responsibility by the definite appointment of a
public Guardian who would enter upon the relation
of co-guardian with the parents of every
child at the registration of its birth?</p>

<p>Even now fundamental parental obligations are
supposed to be the same in all classes, but the
well-to-do can fulfil them after a fashion without
the assistance of the State, though often with
much insecurity and strain. Were there a department
of Public Guardianship upon which
every parent might rely for counsel and effective
help, very many whose difficulty is not the actual
housing and feeding of their children would be
only too glad to take advantage of its advice.
And even amongst the well-to-do, fathers and
mothers die or lose their faculties, or are unfit,
and the nation’s children are the sufferers.</p>

<p>The appointment of a Public Guardian to cooperate
with parents in all ranks of society is the
only effective method, not only of preventing the
national disgrace of “waste children,” but of
doing away with the hardships, the distrusts, the
fears and the resentments caused amongst the
workers by the present harsh and ill-defined
exercise of national Guardianship.</p>

<p>It is to the collective interest of a nation that
its children should flourish. They are the future
nation. To them the State will be entrusted.
To them the work, the duty, the scheme
of things will be handed on. Suppose children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
were recognised to be more important than
wealth—suppose they were really put first—what
machinery have we which already deals with their
lives, their health, and their comfort? We have
a national system of education which we propose
to extend and elaborate, and to which we have
recently attached medical inspection, and we
have the time-honoured machinery of the home.
The children of the poor pass their lives within
the limits of these two institutions, and behind
both stands the State, which entirely regulates
one and is constantly modifying the other.</p>

<p>To equip the home for the vital responsibility
committed to its care, the new administrative
agency must have the power to go further than
the offering of advice and information to its fellow-guardians,
the parents. It must endow every
child who needs it with a grant sufficient to secure
it a minimum of health and comfort. Maintenance
grants from the State are no new thing.
Inadequate grants are now made to the parents
of free scholars in secondary schools. What is
wanted is the extension and development of the
idea. Based on the need of the child and limited
thereby, the grant would not become a weapon
to keep down wages. Men and women whose
children are secure are free to combine, to strike,
to take risks. Men and women who have the
entire burden of a family on their shoulders are
not really free to do so.</p>

<p>The State’s guarantee of the necessaries of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to every child could be fulfilled through various
channels—some of them, as the feeding of school-children,
already in existence. This is no suggestion
for class differentiation. The scholars on
the foundation of many of the great public schools,
such as Eton and Winchester, are fed, as well as
housed and educated, from the funds of old endowments.
National school feeding, endowed
from national wealth, would be an enlargement
and amalgamation of systems already in being.
There should be no such thing as an underfed
school child: an underfed child is a disgrace and a
danger to the State.</p>

<p>The medical inspection of school-children, extended
to children of all classes, should lead to a
universal system of school clinics, where the
children would not only be examined, but treated.
Baby clinics should be within the reach of every
mother, and should be centres where doctors and
nurses, at intervals to be dictated by them, would
weigh and examine every child born within their
district. At this moment any weighing centre,
school for mothers, or baby clinic which does
exist is fighting the results of bad housing, insufficient
food, and miserable clothing—evils
which no medical treatment can cure. Such
evils would be put an end to by the State grant.</p>

<p>Nor would an intolerable system of inspection
be necessary in order to see that the co-trustees
of the State—the parents—should faithfully perform
their part of the great work they are undertaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
At every baby clinic the compulsory
attendances of a well-dressed, well-nourished,
well-cared-for child would be marked as satisfactory.
No inspection needed. An unsatisfactory
child would perhaps be obliged to attend
more often, or its condition might require the help
and guidance of a health visitor in the home. In
this way a merely less efficient home would easily
be distinguished from one which was impossible.
The somewhat inefficient home might be helped,
improved, and kept together, while, if the home
conditions were hopelessly bad, the public guardian
would in the last resort exercise its power of
making fresh provision for the ward of the nation
in some better home.</p>

<p>As things now are, we have machinery by which
the State in its capacity of co-guardian coerces
the parents and urges on them duties which,
unaided, they cannot perform. Parents are to
feed, clothe, and house their children decently,
or they can be dealt with by law. But when, as
a matter of fact, it is publicly demonstrated that
millions of parents cannot do this, and that the
children are neither fed, clothed, nor housed
decently, the State, which is guardian-in-chief,
finds it convenient to look the other way, shirking
its own responsibility, but falling foul, in special
instances, of parents who have failed to comply
with the law.</p>

<p>The law which is supposed to exist for the purpose
of protecting children, seems to exist for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
purpose of punishing parents, while doing nothing,
or next to nothing, for the children. The idea
still prevails among some care committees and
school authorities that a “bad” parent must not
be “encouraged” by feeding his children at
school, and cases are known to exist where, in
order to punish the parent, a hungry child is not
fed. The one mistake an authority which considered
the children first would not make would
be that of punishing the child to spite the parent.
Between Boards of Guardians, Care Committees,
School Authorities, and Police, parents who are
poor are baffled and puzzled and disheartened.
It would be well for them to have a central
authority whose first thought was the real welfare
of the children of the State, and who blamed
and punished parents only when it was clear that
they deserved blame and punishment. That
would be real, not false, “relief” of the poor.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
